## Stunted growth / height?
### Maybe
> Isotretinoin might cause growth impairment by inducing premature fusion of the growth plates, which seems to be associated with younger age, incremental doses, and the duration of the therapy, beyond individual susceptibility.

### No?
> We found that the cohorts of patients treated with isotretinoin did not have lower mean body height, and in fact had statistically significantly higher mean body height than the control cohorts of the same sex.

> Olfactory dysfunction was more prevalent among ISO users, despite the patients being unaware of the disorder.

### Dietary Supplement (gamma linolenic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, coenzyme Q10 and Vitis Vitifera)
> Results: Patients treated with dietary supplement had lower side effects, with a less degree of erythema and dryness, and greater degree of hydration; a greater adherence to therapy was also reported.

### Biotin
> Biotin (10 mg/day) given in addition to isotretinoin treatment decreased telogen and increased anagen hair rates and helped to maintain skin hydration. The use of 10 mg/day biotin can prevent the mucocutaneous adverse effects of isotretinoin treatment.

## Help with side effects 3
### Taurine
> The results showed that oral administration of Isotretinoin induced hepatotoxicity as showed by elevation in ALT, AST, and MDA; also, it reduced intracellular GSH in rat liver tissue. **Administration of taurine prevented the hepatotoxicity induced by isotretinoin in rats significantly. **

### B12 + folic acid
> We concluded that folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during isotretinoin therapy could be useful for preventing folate deficiency and improving blood homocysteine levels; this might as a result reduce the risks for cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders in patients taking isotretinoin.

## Isotretinoin vs adapelene+benzoyl peroxide+doxycycline
> The efficacies showed by topical fixed dose adapalene0.1%/ benzoyl peroxide 2.5% plus doxycycline 200 mg and oral isotretinoin are 82.5% and 92.5%, respectively, having **no significant difference.**

> D+A/BPO showed a favourable composite efficacy/safety profile compared with ISO. This combination is an alternative to ISO in patients intolerant to, or unable or unwilling to take, oral ISO, and is an option for treatment of severe nodular acne.

## Isotretinoin 20mg/day vs azithromycin
> However, in terms of efficacy, isotretinoin 20 mg per day has shown significantly (P < 0.001) better results than azithromycin 500 mg/day recommended for a 10-day cycle **whereas on acne severity grading scale, both treatment strategies were found to be effective with no significant difference (P = 0.29)**
