## Oral collagen for anti-aging
> The results showed that HC supplementation significantly improved skin hydration (test for overall effect: Z = 4.94, p < 0.00001) and elasticity (test for overall effect: Z = 4.49, p < 0.00001) compared to the placebo group

## Oral collagen for pigmentation
> Conclusion: Intake of 5.0 g/day of FCP for 3 months is safe. CP and FCP intake is useful for suppressing pigmentation. In addition, CP intake may be useful for reducing redness. These results suggest a new beneficial effect on the skin of CP supplementation.

## Oral collagen for atopic dermatitis
> The eruption area, SCORAD, and TEWL at week 12 were reduced significantly compared with the initial values in the CTP but not CP group. A significant reduction in the serum TARC level was observed only in the CTP group at week 12. Other blood parameters were not improved in either group.
