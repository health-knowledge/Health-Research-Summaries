# Rehmannia Glutinosa Leaf Extract (RGLE) for acne

> Results: The mean GAGS score was reduced by 21.72% and 14.20% on day 28 in RGLE (n=10) and placebo groups (n=12), respectively, which further reduced in both groups on day 56. The RGLE group reported better improvement in other skin characteristics on day 56. No safety or tolerability concerns were reported for the extract. RGLE reduced acne and improved the skin quality in females compared to placebo as early as 28 days of supplementation.
