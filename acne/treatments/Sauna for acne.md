# Sauna for acne

Saunas, especially infrared ones, may help manage acne by promoting sweating, improving circulation, nitric oxide release (see https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1286512299493822587), and reducing psychological stress.

Although this doesn't necessarily mean acne was improved. Anecdotally, some people have said it makes it worse in some cases, possibly if overdone or not rehydrating afterward:

How to Sauna Safely for Acne
1. Hydrate before, during and after you sauna. Sweating leads to dehydration, and dehydration can aggravate acne. 
2. Wash your face before getting into the sauna, so that you don’t end up with excess dirt sitting on top of your sweaty skin. This probably goes without saying, but don’t wear makeup into the sauna. 
3. Wash your face immediately after getting out of the sauna to remove any of the impurities you just sweat out. This is an excellent time to use a gentle exfoliant, since your skin will be soft from the heat. 
4. Don’t touch your face! Oil and dirt from your fingers are likely to clog your pores. This goes for your time outside of the sauna, too. 
5. Be mindful of the products you're using on your skin and in your hair, since sweating can make it even more likely that these products get deep into your pores and cause problems.
