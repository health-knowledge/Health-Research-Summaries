Jaruthiti P. Master’s Thesis. Thammasat University; Bangkok, Thailand: 2021. The Efficacy and Safety of Topical Hemp Seed Extract in Treatment of Acne Vulgaris: A Split-Face, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Controlled Trial.

Key Findings:
1. Hemp seed extract cream significantly reduced inflammatory acne lesions compared to placebo:
"Within group analysis, mean number of inflammatory acne lesion was statistically significant decreased in hempseed extract cream-treated side, from the second week of the treatment continuously all the way through the study. The mean reduction of inflammatory acne lesions from baseline to week 12 was 12.27±5.52 to 7.05±3.43 (P<0.001) in hemp seed extract cream-treated side."

2. Hemp seed extract cream significantly reduced sebum production:
"At week 8 and week 12 of the study, hemp seed extracted-treated side showed the superior reduction of mean sebum level over placebo-treated side with statistically significant at P-value < 0.001"

3. The hemp seed extract cream was well-tolerated with minimal side effects:
"Adverse events found in hemp seed extract cream were mild, including skin dryness and itchiness. There was no serious adverse effects presented in both interventions."

4. Patients were more satisfied with the hemp seed extract cream compared to placebo:
"At the end of the study, patients were more satisfied with hemp seed extract cream than placebo. The percentage of patients who satisfied (the one who given a score 1 or 2) with the product was 66.67% for hemp seed extract cream and 50% for placebo."

Limitations:
"Nevertheless, the study's limitations were the limited the small sample size, loss of long term follow up period and mask wearing due to covid-19 situation."
The small sample size (20 subjects initially, 18 completing the study) limits the generalizability of the results. The lack of long-term follow-up means the long-term efficacy and safety are unknown.
