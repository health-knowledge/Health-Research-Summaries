## Topical probiotic vs benzoyl peroxide
> Conclusion: Probiotic-derived lotion is safe and effective for treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, a comparable outcome with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. It could be an alternative treatment of acne with more minor side effects.

## Azithromycin vs probiotics
> Conclusion: Probiotics have equal efficacy to azithromycin, and their combination has shown synergistic effects for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Probiotics should be used in combination with azithromycin for the best results for the management of acne vulgaris.

## Doxycycline vs Doxycycline+probiotics
Probiotics shows benefit when combined with oral antibiotics
> Treatment with probiotics significantly reduced the severity of lesions compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The acne grading method also indicated that the intervention group had a significantly better treatment response than the control group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, treatment with probiotics did not result in any side effects.
