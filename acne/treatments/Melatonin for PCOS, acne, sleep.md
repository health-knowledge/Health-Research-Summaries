> Conclusion: Melatonin supplementation showed positive effect on blood sugar and somehow insulin resistance whereas it could not improve ICU complications.

> Conclusions: Overall, melatonin administration for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, and gene expression of PPAR-γ and LDLR among women with PCOS.

> Conclusions: Co-supplementation with magnesium and melatonin had beneficial effects on sleep quality and total testosterone. Additionally, melatonin supplementation alone was found to be associated with a significant reduction in PSQI score. Moreover, combined melatonin and magnesium supplementation was more effective in improving serum levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and insulin, and HOMA-IR.

> Overall, we found a favorable effect of co-supplementation of magnesium and melatonin for 8 weeks in women with PCOS on hirsutism, serum TNF-α, and TAC levels.

> Conclusions: Overall, melatonin administration for 12 weeks to women with PCOS significantly reduced hirsutism, total testosterone, hs-CRP, and MDA, while increasing TAC and GSH levels. In addition, melatonin administration reduced gene expression of IL-1 and TNF-α.
