## Glutathione supps on body stores of glutathione
"These findings show, for the first time, that daily consumption of GSH supplements was effective at increasing body compartment stores of GSH."

## Decreased glutathione in acne patients
"Conclusions: We conclude that a decline in antioxidative activity led by a decrease in GSH quantity may play an important role in pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. The use of α-MSH may further decrease the GSH level."
