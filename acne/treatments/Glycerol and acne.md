# Glycerol and acne

Studies and dermatological insights suggest that glycerol can indirectly benefit acne-prone skin by supporting the skin barrier, reducing irritation, and preventing excessive dryness, which are common side effects of acne treatments. Glycerol is widely used in acne skincare formulations for its ability to hydrate the skin without clogging pores, helping to maintain a balanced and healthy skin environment that may reduce the likelihood of acne worsening.

Interestingly, there are only a handful of studies directly looking at glycerol's relationship with acne.

## Glycerol levels in acne
The level of glycerol on the skin surface of acne patients is lower than expected, but increases after treatment with oral tetracycline. 
The authors suggested that glycerol may be a substrate for the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. It is unclear whether glycerol is beneficial or not based on this study.

## Glycerol fermentation and acne
The skin microbiome can ferment glycerol, which is naturally produced in the skin, to inhibit the growth of P. acnes. This fermentation produces lactic acid, which also inhibits the growth of P. acnes.

## Glycerol and the skin microbiome
Glycerol fermentation by bacteria in the skin microbiome can upregulate genes associated with the skin's barrier properties.

Theory: Lowering systemic insulin levels may encourage lipolysis in sebaceous glands, increasing free glycerol on the skin to support beneficial bacteria that inhibit P. acnes and potentially reduce acne.
