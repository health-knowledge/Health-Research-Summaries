## Oral treatments 1

**Carotenoids, Glutathione (https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1269559943321620580), Polypodium leucotomos extract**
Jafry, M., Guan, L. L., & Mohammad, T. F. (2024). A practical guide to over‐the‐counter treatments for hyperpigmentation. JEADV Clinical Practice, 3(2), 433-447.

> Based on existing research, the most promising oral remedies for hyperpigmentation appear to be **tranexamic acid, glutathione, isotretinoin, and proanthocyanidin**. Additional studies to better establish safety and efficacy are necessary.

Shimshak, Serena J E et al. “A Review of Oral Therapies for the Treatment of Skin Hyperpigmentation.” Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery vol. 26,2 (2022): 169-175. doi:10.1177/12034754211045391

> Discussion: Hyperpigmentation is one of the most common post-laser complications, especially in dark skin types. Supplementation with **w-3 PUFAs** has a potential in diminishing inflammatory processes, which could be beneficial for the management of PIH after laser.

Campos, Valeria, et al. "42807 A comparative study of the efficacy of oral omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids vectorized in marine phospholipids to prevent the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in dark skin types after a non-ablative laser."

## Oral treatments 2

### Isotretinoin on pre-existing atrophic acne scars
> Besides its well-known effect on acne vulgaris, OI also could be an effective treatment option for reducing scar size and severity while improving skin elasticity. SWE may help follow skin and scar properties.

Turk, C. B., Baykara Ulusan, M., Döş, Y. M., Manav Baş, V., Sarikaya Tellal, E., & Koku Aksu, A. E. (2023). The Effects of Oral Isotretinoin on Atrophic Acne Scars Measured by Shear-wave Elastography: An Observational, Single-center Study. The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology, 16(9), 46–51.

> This is the first paper showing the improvement of scars by early low dose-isotretinoin intervention with or without the combination of picosecond laser. Early intervention with oral low-dose isotretinoin is effective for the treatment and prevention of acne scars, the combined therapy with FxPico can achieve better outcome.

Xue, Huan et al. “Efficacy and safety of low-dose oral isotretinoin monotherapy versus combined therapy with picosecond laser for the treatment of acne scars in Asian population.” Lasers in surgery and medicine vol. 55,4 (2023): 359-371. doi:10.1002/lsm.23646
