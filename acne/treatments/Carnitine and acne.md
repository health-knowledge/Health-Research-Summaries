## Topical L-carnitine for sebum reduction

> Topically applied L-carnitine is bioavailable and leads to a significant sebum reduction in vivo. In conclusion, L-carnitine represents a valuable compound, produced naturally within the body, for the topical treatment of oily skin in humans.

## Topical licochalcone A, l-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol

> active formulation group showed at the end of the study a reduction in the mean total lesions count and papular lesions, significant reduction in the pustules (P < 0.05) and sebum levels (P < 0.01), marked reduction in P. acnes and improvement of DLQI

## Sunscreen formulation containing licochalcone A (LicA) and L-carnitine (LC) as an adjuvant to adapalene in the management of acne and post-acne pigmentation (PAH). 
> Conclusion: The concurrent use of LicA-containing sunscreen with adapalene may improve the cutaneous tolerance to adapalene among Malaysian patients.

# Carnitine for isotretinoin side effects
> Iso therapy decreases car blood levels in patients with CA. L-car supplementation might treat liver and muscular side effects of the drug. These hopeful preliminary results need further investigation.

# Diabetes
> L-carnitine plays a potential role as adjunctive therapy in diabetes. Additional research is necessary for patients with higher baseline HbA1c and type 1 diabetes.

## Stearoylcarnitine as protective against acne

> We eliminated the possibility of reverse causality and verified that the identified metabolites were responsible for the acne vulgaris phenotype. Stearoylcarnitine is a protective factor in acne vulgaris

Wang, X., Wu, Y., Zhao, P., Wang, X., Wu, W., & Yang, J. (2024). The causal relationship between serum metabolites and acne vulgaris: a Mendelian randomization study. Scientific reports, 14(1), 11045. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61850-5

Stearoylcarnitine is formed in the body from two key nutrients: stearic acid (a saturated fat found in cocoa butter, animal fats) and L-carnitine (found primarily in red meat, poultry, and fish). While direct dietary intervention studies are still needed, this Mendelian randomization study suggests these nutrients may play a role in acne through their contribution to stearoylcarnitine formation. The protective effect appears to work through multiple mechanisms, including immune modulation and lipid metabolism pathways.
