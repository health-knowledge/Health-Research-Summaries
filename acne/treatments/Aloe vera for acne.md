# Aloe vera for acne

> TR/Aloe vera gel (AVG) was significantly more effective in reducing non-inflammatory (p = 0.001), inflammatory (p = 0.011) and total (p = 0.003) lesion scores than control group. The highest percentage of adverse cutaneous effect was reported for scaling. At the end of study, erythema in the TR/AVG-treated group was significantly less severe (p = 0.046). Conclusion: The combination TR/AVG was well tolerated and significantly more effective than TR and vehicle for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.
