## A clinical trial found that 5% tea-tree oil gel is effective in treating mild to moderate acne, similar to 5% benzoyl peroxide, but with fewer side effects and a slower onset of action.
> The results of this study showed that both 5% tea-tree oil and 5% benzoyl peroxide had a significant effect in ameliorating the patients' acne by reducing the number of inflamed and non-inflamed lesions (open and closed comedones), although the onset of action in the case of tea-tree oil was slower. Encouragingly, fewer side effects were experienced by patients treated with tea-tree oil.

## Tea tree oil gel significantly improved acne severity and lesion count compared to placebo, making it an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris.
> There was a significant difference between tea tree oil gel and placebo in the improvement of the TLC and also regarding improvement of the ASI. In terms of TLC and ASI, tea tree oil gel was 3.55 times and 5.75 times more effective than placebo respectively. Side-effects with both groups were relatively similar and tolerable.

> ## Conclusion Tea tree oil is comparable to benzoyl peroxide in treating mild acne vulgaris among teenagers and young adults.

> Results Both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide groups showed a significant decrease in the posttreatment lesion counts compared to the baseline, however when the mean differences were compared between groups, the difference was not significant.

> Likewise, the increased risk of side effects of TTO, which include dryness of skin and pruritus, must also be taken into consideration.

> ## Conclusion: The PTAC formulation was better than ERC in reducing erythema scars, acne severity index, and total lesion count.
