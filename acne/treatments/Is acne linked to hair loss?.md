# Is acne linked to hair loss?

## 5AR blockers

### Finasteride in women
Nine out of the twelve women who were treated with finasteride, and who suffered from acne or alopecia with normal serum levels of free testosterone, showed significant improvement in their symptoms. This suggests that excessive activity of the enzyme 5α-reductase could be a factor in these conditions. [1]

## C. acnes
Another article suggests that Propionibacterium acnes colonization of the terminal hair follicles might play a role in the pathogenesis of hair casts and possibly diffuse non-scarring alopecia. [2]

## Concurrent diagnosis [3]
> There was a statistically significant risk of having a concurrent diagnosis of acne in patients with underlying AGA (OR = 3.86, P < 0.001) compared with HCs

## Severity not linked
Neither a relationship between the severity of androgenetic alopecia and severity of acne, nor a relationship between acne severity and androgenetic alopecia subtype were found in this study. Thus, acne severity is independent of the subtype and stage of the co-existing androgenetic alopecia. [4]

## Sebum levels
> The results of this study showed a positive correlation (p<0.01) with a very strong strength between sebum level and severity of AGA (r=0.94). Conclusion: There is a very strong correlation between sebum level and severity of AGA.

## SRD5A1

Studies investigating plant extracts for their anti‐acne effects have measured changes in the expression of SRD5A1 in cultured skin cells (such as keratinocytes) and found that downregulating SRD5A1 correlates with reduced sebum production and potentially fewer acne lesions. These findings support the concept that increased SRD5A1 activity in the skin is one of the factors driving the pathogenesis of acne.

### No sebum reduction in those with 5AR2 defiency
> Furthermore, lowering DHT levels in adulthood had no effect on sebum production. If the gland is rich in the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase-2, it is proposed that the sebaceous gland is either exquisitely sensitive to DHT, requiring only small amounts for normal development and function, or that male levels of testosterone compensate for DHT and maintain normal sebaceous gland activity throughout life. It is also possible that 5 alpha-reductase-1 is the enzyme of the sebaceous gland and is unaffected in the inherited condition and by finasteride.

### 5AR1 inhibitor only - no benefit
> In this trial, a potent and selective type I 5a-reductase inhibitor was not significantly different from placebo in the treatment of moderately severe inflammatory acne.

### Dutasteride case study of 2 men - possible benefits?
> In our cases, it seems that dutasteride improved AGA and acne vulgaris by inhibiting type II and type I 5α - reductase, respectively. In this respect, dutasteride could be a novel option for the treatment of male patients with both AGA and acne vulgaris.
