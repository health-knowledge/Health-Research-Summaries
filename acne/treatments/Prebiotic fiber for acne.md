# Prebiotic fiber for acne

## Lower fiber intake observed in acne patients
> Patients with acne had a significantly higher family history of acne compared to controls (P=0.006). Serum level of **malondialdehyde was significantly higher in cases (P=0.01)**, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly lower (P=0.02). Moreover, significantly **lower fiber intake was observed in cases **compared with controls (P=0.007).

## Psyllium husk (soluble fiber)
> Conclusion: Patients in both subgroups who received psyllium in addition to antibiotics and systemic retinoids treatment showed better results after treatment in terms of **skin condition**, overall health and quality of life.

> Conclusion: A cream containing retinoid molecules and Iris Florentina root extract is effective and well tolerated in the management of AFA. The treatment combination with a prebiotic and anti-inflammatory food supplement offers an additional clinical benefit mainly in reducing inflammatory lesions and improving the severity acne score. 

 - Limitations: Food supplement containing a mixture of prebiotic molecules (FOS&GOS) zinc, lactoferrin, and niacinamide, not just one ingredient

## Topical Glucomannan hydrolysates (GMH)
> The results showed that there was a significant (P< 0.001) improvement of the skin health at the second (20 days) and third clinical evaluation (40 days) for established (e.g. antibiotics) and GMH treatments.

Potential fiber side effects:
- Can cause gas, bloating, and digestive discomfort, especially when started at high doses (depending on the prebiotic fiber type)
- May interfere with absorption of certain medications and nutrients.
