## Oral Vitamin C + antibiotic better than antibiotic alone for acne
> Conclusion: Significant elevation (p less than 0.001) in the serum levels of (IL-8, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TLR-2) among moderate to severe acne patients in comparison to control group. **Clinically the combination of doxycycline plus vitamin C was more efficient as therapeutically in comparison to doxycycline alone**. Immunologically doxycycline plus vitamin C was more effective in reducing serum levels of (IL-8, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TLR-2) in comparison to doxycycline alone.
