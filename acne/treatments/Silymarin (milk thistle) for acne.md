# Silymarin (milk thistle) for acne

## Antioxidants including silymarin for acne
Oral antioxidants, Silymarin, N-acetylcysteine, and Selenium, effectively reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in acne patients, improving clinical improvement and biochemical data.

## Silymarin comparable to doxycycline for acne
> The results of our study indicated that the silymarin therapeutic effects are comparable to doxycycline in the GAGS index, although it is lower compared to doxycycline in the ASI (Figures 1–3). This study also examined the synergistic effects of silymarin and doxycycline compared to doxycycline alone. Adding silymarin to the doxycycline regimen improved the effect of doxycycline therapy.

## Protective during accutane/isotretinoin
Silymarin effectively prevents increased liver enzymes in patients taking isotretinoin, making it a low-cost, low-complication treatment for this issue.

Potential side effects:
- Rarely associated with allergic reactions
- May cause gastrointestinal upset in some individuals
- Potential hormonal effects due to its weak estrogenic properties

## Topical silymarin cream for acne
> Topical silymarin cream 1.4% showed comparable results to Salicylic acid 30% peels. It can be considered a promising safe treatment modality for mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

> Hyperpigmentation was recorded in 2 cases on the salicylic acid-treated side. No side effects for silymarin cream were observed.

>  Results: After a 4-week application, the modified Global Acne Grading Score (mGAGS), Global Evaluation Acne (GEA) scale, and the acne lesion counts were significantly decreased. Sebum secretion, skin pigmentation, and erythema were also reduced during the study period, yet only the melanin pigmentation index reached statistical significance. Subgroup analysis revealed that the patients who took the low-dose oral isotretinoin during the study period showed more noticeable improvements in skin sebum output and melanin pigmentation. Additionally, no adverse event was associated with using the 0.5% SAS.

## Glucose/lipid metabolic dysfunction
> Supplementation of silymarin may be effective and safe for the management of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.
