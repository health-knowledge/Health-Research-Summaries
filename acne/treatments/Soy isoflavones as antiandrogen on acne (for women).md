Traditional soy preparation methods based on their prevalence in East Asian cuisines:
Soy sauce: Undoubtedly the most ubiquitous soy product across East Asia. It's used daily in cooking and as a condiment in China, Japan, and Korea.
Tofu: A very close second, tofu is a staple protein source in all three countries, used in countless dishes.
Miso (in Japan) / Douchi (in China): These fermented soybean products are essential in their respective cuisines. Miso is fundamental to Japanese cooking, while douchi is a key flavoring in many Chinese dishes.
Soy milk: Traditionally consumed in China and other parts of East Asia, though its popularity has increased in recent decades.
Edamame: Common as a snack or side dish, particularly in Japan, but also enjoyed in China and Korea.
Natto: While extremely popular in certain regions of Japan, it's less common in other East Asian countries.
Tempeh: Originally from Indonesia, it's less traditional in East Asian cuisines but has gained popularity in recent years, especially in vegetarian cooking.
