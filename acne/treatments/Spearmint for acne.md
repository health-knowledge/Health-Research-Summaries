## Spearmint tea
An older 2010 study published in the journal Phytotherapy Research found drinking spearmint tea twice daily for one month reduced hirsutism (excess hair) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The researchers concluded the tea may have anti-androgen (male hormone) effects on the body.
