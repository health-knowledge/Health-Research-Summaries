# Topical zinc for acne

## Based on Beyond The Surface - AI based review (check attached file to trace claims)

> Five percent zinc sulfate solution was statistically significant in reducing the disease severity score in acne rosacea, while 2% tea lotion was beneficial but did not reach statistically significant level as zinc sulfate solution. Conclusion: Five percent zinc sulfate solution was a good alternative remedy to be used in patients with acne rosacea.

- Zinc seems particularly effective when combined with other active ingredients, especially antibiotics like erythromycin.
- The effectiveness of zinc varies across studies, with some showing significant benefits and others showing more modest improvements.
- Zinc oxide nanoparticles in topical formulations show promise in treating acne-causing bacteria.
- Some studies found zinc-containing treatments to be as effective as or superior to other common acne treatments like benzoyl peroxide.
- The efficacy of zinc may depend on the specific formulation and concentration used.
- While generally beneficial, zinc was not always found to be more effective than other treatments or placebos in every study.

## Based on a review of zinc for acne

1. One study (Cochran et al., 1985) tested topical zinc sulfate (2% elemental zinc) applied three times daily for 12 weeks. However, this study found no significant difference compared to placebo.
2. Several studies examined topical zinc combined with other ingredients, particularly antibiotics:
  - Zinc acetate (1.2%) + erythromycin (4%) was studied in multiple trials and found to be effective, sometimes superior to erythromycin alone or placebo.
  - Zinc acetate (1.2%) + clindamycin (1%) was studied but not found to be significantly better than clindamycin alone.
  - A cream containing zinc pyrrolidone (0.1%) + Laminaria digitata-derived oligosaccharide was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing acne lesions.
3. Topical zinc formulations were generally well-tolerated, though some studies reported mild skin irritation.
4. The review suggests topical zinc combinations, especially with antibiotics like erythromycin, may be more effective than zinc alone for acne treatment.
5. However, the authors note more large-scale, well-designed studies are needed to determine optimal treatment regimens for zinc in acne therapy.

So while topical zinc was discussed, the evidence was mixed, with combinations showing more promise than zinc alone applied topically.

## Acne.org review of literature
> From the research we have thus far, topical zinc by itself is unlikely to clear acne. But researchers have studied only a small number of zinc compounds for their effectiveness in treating acne, so more research is needed to identify what zinc compound, if any, may prove beneficial in treating or preventing acne.
