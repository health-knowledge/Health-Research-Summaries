# Jojoba oil for acne (weak evidence)

> Conclusions: The present study gives preliminary evidence that healing clay jojoba oil facial masks can be effective treatment for lesioned skin and mild acne vulgaris.

Limitations:
**Lack of Control Group**
- **Why it matters:** Without a placebo or comparison group (e.g., clay mask alone, or no treatment), we can’t isolate whether the **jojoba oil** contributed to the results, or if improvements were due to:
  - The clay alone (which already has benefits for acne)
  - A placebo effect
  - Natural acne fluctuations over 6 weeks

**Open-Label Design (No Blinding)**
- **Why it matters:** Participants knew what they were using. This can lead to:
  - **Reporting bias** (participants may overestimate improvement)
  - **Expectation effects** (feeling better because they *think* the product should help)

**Self-Reported Lesion Counts**
- **Why it matters:** Participants counted their own acne lesions, which introduces:
  - **Subjectivity**
  - **Inconsistent accuracy** (especially for comedones or subtle changes)
  - Lack of **clinical verification** by dermatologists or trained staff

**High Dropout or Incomplete Data**
- **Why it matters:** Of the 194 participants, only **133 returned complete lesion counts** (~69%).
  - Missing data could skew results.
  - Those who improved may have been more likely to complete the study, introducing **attrition bias**.

**Gender and Age Imbalance**
- **Why it matters:** The study population was **overwhelmingly female (99%)**, and **average age was ~32 years**.
  - Not generalizable to:
    - Male populations (who may respond differently to oils)
    - Teenagers (a major acne group)
    - People with hormonal or cystic acne types
