# Inositol ("Vitamin B8") for acne, PCOS

> Conclusion: In conclusion, these observations suggest that inositol may be useful as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of female patients with moderate acne, especially in the case of women who are unable to receive combined estrogen-progestin therapy due to various reasons (e.g., increased risk of thrombosis, and side effects associated with the use of estrogen-progestin).

> Results: After 3 months of MYO administration, plasma LH, testosterone, free testosterone, insulin and HOMA index resulted significantly reduced; no significant changes were observed in plasma FSH and androstenedione levels. Both hirsutism and acne decreased after 6 months of therapy.

Limitations:
- Combination treatment: The study used myo-inositol combined with folic acid, making it impossible to attribute the effects solely to myo-inositol.
- Lack of control group: There was no placebo or control group, which limits the ability to determine if the effects were due to the treatment or other factors.
