# Systems - Decreased Immune System Function

- Role of Immune System in Acne: Acne vulgaris, a prevalent skin condition, involves a complex interplay of factors including sebum production, bacterial colonization, and inflammatory responses. The immune system plays a crucial role in this process. It is stimulated by elements like Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), which leads to an inflammatory response. This inflammation is a key aspect of acne development​
- Immune Activity and Inflammation: The immune system's activity is central to the pathogenesis of acne. Recent research has shed light on how skin immune cells, both innate and adaptive, respond to various stimuli in acne. The exact mechanisms of immune cell activity in acne, especially the temporal and spatial patterns, are still being explored. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted acne treatments​
- Interactions Between Bacteria and the Immune System: Cutibacterium acnes, formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes, interacts with the skin's immune system in several ways. These interactions can lead to inflammation, which is a core component of acne development. The bacteria interact with toll-like receptors (TLRs), inflammasomes, and stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which all play a role in the inflammatory response. Cells of the adaptive immune response, mainly Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, are also significant in acne's pathogenesis​

- Overactivation of the Immune System: In the context of acne, the immune system's overreaction, often due to stress or irritation, can exacerbate the condition. Inflammatory responses, crucial in acne formation, are driven by the immune system. Factors that overstimulate the immune system, such as harsh chemicals or other irritants, can worsen acne​
- Regulation of Immune Response: It's also suggested that certain bacteria and probiotics can help "train" the immune system not to overreact, reducing the severity of immune reactions in the skin. This regulation can potentially moderate the inflammatory processes involved in acne​

Common Reasons for decreased function:
- Age and Autoimmune Diseases: Similar to the initial response, aging naturally weakens the immune system. Additionally, autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease can also compromise immune function​​​
- Poor Nutrition: Consistent with the initial response, a diet lacking in essential nutrients can weaken the immune system. This includes malnutrition, which can severely impair immune responses​
- Chronic Stress: Long-term stress weakens the immune system's responses, aligning with the initial statement. Stress leads to the release of hormones like cortisol, which can suppress immune function​
- Lack of Sleep: Not getting enough sleep is a significant factor that can weaken the immune system, as previously mentioned​
- Medical Conditions and Treatments: There are several specific conditions and treatments that weaken the immune system, including HIV/AIDS, certain types of cancer, and treatments like chemotherapy. These conditions and treatments can lead to acquired immune deficiencies​
- Additional Factors: Temporary immune deficiencies can be caused by certain medicines, infections like the flu, mono, and measles, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use

> There were significantly higher serum midkine levels in acne vulgaris patients (mean ± SD: 397.2 ± 150.3 pg/ml) compared to controls (mean ± SD: 212.5 ± 65.4 pg/ml; P < 0.001)
