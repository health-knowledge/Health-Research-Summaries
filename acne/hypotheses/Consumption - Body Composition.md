# Consumption - Body Composition

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Acne: Studies have found associations between BMI and acne. For instance, a population-based study suggested a possible relationship between BMI and acne in adolescents, indicating that body composition might influence acne prevalence ([Halvorsen et al., 2012](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1105449)). Another study found that higher BMI was a significant risk factor for acne formation in schoolchildren, suggesting that obesity, which is frequently accompanied by peripheral hyperandrogenism, may be associated with increased sebum production and the development of severe acne ([Tsai et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16709487/)).

Obesity and Acne: A nationwide study of 600,404 adolescents found that overweight and obesity are** inversely associated with acne **in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the **relationship between body composition and acne might be complex and not entirely understood** ([Snast et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962219305894?via%3Dihub)).

Hyperandrogenism, Obesity, and Acne Severity: A study on the effects of hyperandrogenism and high body mass index on acne severity in women found that the prevalence of hyperandrogenism and obesity was increased in women with acne. It suggested that circulating androgen levels and BMI play a key role in the severity of acne ([Alan & Çenesizoğlu, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25129194/)).

> Conclusion: No significant association was found between age group, gender, BMI, and acne. To fully comprehend how dietary factors affect the severity of acne, more studies are required.

##  Patients with acne vulgaris have a greater chance of developing MetS
> Cases and controls were comparable with respect to parameters like age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DSBP), and serum triglyceride while fasting blood sugar (FBS, case > control) and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL, control > case) were significantly different (P < 0.05, independent t-test). Prevalence of MetS was higher in cases (32%) than controls (14%), though comparable (P = 0.06, Chi-square). Only SBP, FBS, and serum HDL showed a significant correlation with the severity of acne. Obesity was comparable between cases (18%) and controls (10%), without any relation to acne severity.

> Conclusion Patients with acne vulgaris have a greater chance of developing MetS. Hence, an in-depth examination of clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters that may lead to the development of MetS is necessary.

> Conclusions The findings suggest that higher BMI z-scores are linked to increased acne severity.

## High body fat may indicate increased risk and severity of acne
> Conclusion: Since high body fat may indicate increased risk and severity of acne, body composition analysis may be useful in treating patients with acne and taking preventive measures against metabolic syndrome in this population.

## No casual relationship based on mendelian randomization
> Conclusion: Our findings suggested that there is no causal relationship between BMI and acne.
