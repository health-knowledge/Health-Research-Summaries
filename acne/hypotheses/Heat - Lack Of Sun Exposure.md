Sunlight as a Natural Remedy: All three videos touch upon the benefits of sunlight for skin health, although each from a different perspective. The first video directly discusses the personal experience of the speaker with sunlight improving his acne and seborrheic dermatitis. This aligns with the third video's emphasis on sunlight's general health benefits, including for skin, through mechanisms like the production of Vitamin D and the release of nitric oxide by UVA radiation.

    The Role of Vitamin D and Nitric Oxide: While the first video focuses on Vitamin D’s role in skin health, the third video expands on this by introducing the importance of nitric oxide released through UVA radiation. Both Vitamin D and nitric oxide are suggested to have positive effects on skin health, which can indirectly influence acne management. https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1286512299493822587

    Balancing Sun Exposure: The third video stresses the importance of balancing UVA and UVB radiation exposure. UVA is beneficial for its nitric oxide release, while UVB, although necessary for Vitamin D production, is associated with increased skin cancer risk. The suggestion is to gain sun exposure when the sun is lower in the sky, which could be beneficial for acne without the higher risks associated with excessive UVB exposure.

Dietary Considerations: The second and third videos highlight the significance of diet in managing skin health. The second video emphasizes gut health and dietary changes, indirectly suggesting that these factors could influence skin conditions like acne. The third video discusses the balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and their impact on skin health and resistance to sunburn, which could be relevant for acne sufferers.

    Personal Experience and Lifestyle: The first and second videos include personal anecdotes and lifestyle changes, underscoring the importance of individual experiences and holistic approaches in managing acne. These approaches are not only about sun exposure but also about overall health and wellness practices.

In conclusion, moderate and balanced sun exposure, particularly during times of lower UVB radiation, along with a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and low in omega-6, can potentially be beneficial in managing acne. However, it's important to remember that individual experiences may vary, and consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice is always recommended.

There are studies suggesting 10PM-1PM is the best time to get UVB needed for Vitamin D, and with less UVA risks as the UVB/UVA ratio is different than mornings (where it is mostly just UVA):

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18348449/
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25207380/

Despite this, I think it is best to figure out what your skin type is, your heritage (what geographical region your skin is adapted to), and then based on that, figure out what the best time of day at your current location closes resembles the UVA/UVB ratio, and UV index of your adapted geographical region.

*Sunlight's impact on acne bacteria*

Research indicates that Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria commonly associated with acne, is indeed sensitive to certain types of light, including sunlight. Here are some key findings:

1. **Photosensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes**: Propionibacterium acnes is light-sensitive, with increased photosensitivity during anoxia and increased photodamage in visible light compared to near-UV light. [Kjeldstad, 1987, "DIFFERENT PHOTOINACTIVATION MECHANISMS IN Propionibacterium acnes FOR NEAR‐ULTRAVIOLET and VISIBLE LIGHT", Photochemistry and Photobiology]

2. **Sensitivity to Specific Wavelengths**: The bacterium shows the highest sensitivity at 320 nm and decreasing sensitivity with increasing wavelength. [Kjeldstad & Johnsson, 1986, "AN ACTION SPECTRUM FOR BLUE AND NEAR ULTRAVIOLET IN ACTIVATION OF Propionibacterium acnes; WITH EMPHASIS ON A POSSIBLE PORPHYRIN PHOTOSENSITIZATION", Photochemistry and Photobiology]

3. **Porphyrin-Induced Photosensitization**: The light sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes is due to porphyrin-induced photosensitization, which increases with ALA incubation. [Johansen et al., 2003, "Proton Magic Angle Spinning NMR Reveals New Features in Photodynamically Treated Bacteria", Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C]

4. **Improvement of Acne Lesions with Sunlight**: Acne lesions improve after exposure to sunlight, possibly due to the activation of endogenous porphyrins produced by Propionibacterium acnes. [Hirsch & Shalita, 2003, "Lasers, light, and acne.", Cutis]

5. **Effect of High-Intensity Narrow-Band Blue Light**: This type of light exhibits a phototoxic effect on Propionibacterium acnes, which is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne. [Shalita et al., 2001, "Acne phototherapy using UV-free high-intensity narrow-band blue light: a three-center clinical study"]

6. **UV-Free Blue Light Treatment**: High-intensity, narrow band 405-420 nm UV-free blue light effectively treats acne by photo-destroying acne bacteria through the effects on the porphyrins produced naturally by Propionibacterium acnes. [Elman, Slatkine, & Harth, 2003, "The effective treatment of acne vulgaris by a high‐intensity, narrow band 405–420 nm light source", Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy]

These studies collectively indicate that Propionibacterium acnes is specifically sensitive to certain wavelengths of light, including those present in sunlight, primarily due to the activation of porphyrins within the bacteria under specific light conditions.

*Various wavelengths impact on acne bacteria*

Research has identified several wavelengths of light that are effective at killing acne bacteria, particularly Propionibacterium acnes. Here are some of the most notable findings:

1. **Long-Wave Blue Light (449 nm)**: Sub-milliwatt/cm2 levels of long-wave blue light at 449 nm effectively kill Propionibacterium acnes in vitro. [Boyd et al., 2019, "Propionibacterium acnes susceptibility to low‐level 449 nm blue light photobiomodulation", Lasers in Surgery and Medicine]

2. **Narrow-Band UVB (313 nm)**: Narrow-band UVB at 313 nm is more effective at inhibiting acne bacteria growth than UVA1 (345-440 nm). [Fluhr & Gloor, 1997, "The antimicrobial effect of narrow‐band UVB (313 nm) and UVA1 (345–440 nm) radiation in vitro", Photodermatology]

3. **Intense Pulsed Light (420 nm)**: 420 nm intense pulsed light reduces levels of Propionibacterium acnes. [Fan et al., 2013, "Effects of 420‐nm intense pulsed light in an acne animal model", Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology]

4. **Smooth Pulsed Light (400 to 700 nm)**: IPL with dominant wavelengths of 400 to 700 nm had a satisfactory effect on acne vulgaris in Asians. [Tachihara, Kato, & Omi, 2010, "Effect of Smooth Pulsed Light at 400 to 700 and 870 to 1,200 nm for Acne Vulgaris in Asian Skin", Dermatologic Surgery]

5. **High-Intensity Narrow-Band Blue Light (407-420 nm)**: Exhibits a phototoxic effect on Propionibacterium acnes, reducing acne lesions counts in 8 biweekly treatments. [Shalita et al., 2001, "Acne phototherapy using UV-free high-intensity narrow-band blue light: a three-center clinical study"]

6. **Red Wavelength (Infrared)**: Red wavelength is safe and effective to treat acne vulgaris by LLLT compared to infrared wavelength. [Aziz-Jalali, Tabaie, & Djavid, 2012, "Comparison of Red and Infrared Low-level Laser Therapy in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris", Indian Journal of Dermatology]

7. **400-nm Blue Light**: Effective in treating acnes vulgaris and is used for treating Helicobacter pylori infections. [Halstead et al., 2016, "Antibacterial Activity of Blue Light against Nosocomial Wound Pathogens Growing Planktonically and as Mature Biofilms", Applied and Environmental Microbiology]

8. **Novel IPL Filter (400-600 nm and 800-1,200 nm)**: Effectively treats inflammatory acne lesions with minimal side effects. [Chen et al., 2019, "Efficacy and safety of intense pulsed light in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris with a novel filter", Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy]

9. **Blue LED PDT (405-420 nm)**: Appears effective in treating inflammatory acne. [Borelli et al., 2005, "[Light, laser and PDT therapy for acne]", Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete]

These findings indicate that wavelengths in the blue light spectrum, particularly around 400-450 nm, are highly effective against acne bacteria. Additionally, narrow-band UVB and certain red wavelengths also show efficacy in treating acne vulgaris.

*The safest time of day to get this type of light from the sun*
1. **Early Morning, Just After Sunrise:** This time offers bright visible light with lower UVB levels as the sun's angle is low, making the UVB rays travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs more of these rays.
2. **Late Afternoon, Before Sunset:** In this period, there is still plenty of visible light, but the UVB radiation levels decrease as the sun lowers in the sky. The atmosphere filters out more UVB due to the increased path length of the sunlight.

# Risk from indoor tanning beds
"Sunbed use is a significant health threat, increasing the risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers."

Bali, R et al. “The significant health threat from sunbed use as a self treatment in patients with acne.” Clinical and experimental dermatology vol. 47,2 (2022): 404-406. doi:10.1111/ced.14899

# Risks from sunlight
- **Phototoxic risk during acne treatment**: "Regarding acne treatment, patients under isotretinoin therapy are sometimes forced to stop treatment or at least reduce the dosage due to its photosensitizing effect. 43,44 Other oral photosensitizing drugs are the tetracyclines. In a prospective study of 106 acne patients under treatment with doxycycline over 2 years, 20% of individuals taking doxycycline 150 mg/day and 40% taking 200 mg/day showed a phototoxic reaction,45 and in geographical areas with abundant solar radiation, phototoxic reactions can be frequent at a lower dosage level"

- **PIH Risk for those of colored skin that already have lesions**: "The interaction between sunlight and acneic inflammatory lesions, especially in individuals with skin of color (SOC) such as Asians, Africans, African Americans, and Latin-Americans, can induce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and/or post- inflammatory erythema. Inflammatory or excoriated lesions have a high possibility of PIH"
