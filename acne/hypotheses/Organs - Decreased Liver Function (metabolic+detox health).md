# Organs - Decreased Liver Function (metabolic+detox health)

- Hormonal Imbalance: The liver plays a critical role in regulating hormones. Impaired liver function can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly in the metabolism of androgens and estrogens, which can exacerbate acne.
- [Toxin Buildup](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1210064966259056652): The liver is responsible for detoxifying the blood. If its function is compromised, toxins may accumulate in the body, potentially leading to skin issues like acne.
- Impaired Bile Production: The liver produces bile, which helps in digestion and the absorption of fats. A malfunctioning liver might not produce enough bile, leading to poor digestion and potentially contributing to skin problems. Bile is also used as a detoxification pathway.
- Poor liver function significantly impairs glucose metabolism, primarily through disrupted processes of glycogen storage and gluconeogenesis, leading to increased risks of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and other associated metabolic disorders.

Common Reasons for decreased function:
- Alcohol Abuse: Chronic alcohol abuse is indeed a major cause of liver dysfunction, potentially leading to hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure​
- Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): NAFLD, related to metabolic conditions such as obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood lipids, causes excess fat storage in the liver, leading to inflammation and potential liver damage​. [Fructose and sugar: A major mediator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29408694/)
- Hepatitis: Infections, particularly hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C), are common causes of liver dysfunction due to the inflammation they cause in the liver​
- Medications and Toxins: Toxic hepatitis, caused by chronic overexposure to toxins such as industrial chemicals or drugs, can result in acute or chronic hepatitis, thereby impairing liver function.
- Autoimmune Diseases: Autoimmune conditions, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, affect the liver by causing chronic inflammation and scarring​.
- Nutrient deficiencies

Here are some of the herbs that have shown promise:
- Milk Thistle: Its active component, silymarin, has antioxidant effects that may protect liver cells against damage caused by inflammation and oxidative stress​. <#1260494342053691414> 
- Dandelion Root: Acts as a liver tonic, stimulating bile production and aiding in digestion, which can be particularly beneficial for NAFLD​

- Turmeric: Contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory effects and may help reduce liver fat and support overall liver health​ https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1268511942612619378
- Burdock Root: Used for detox and liver cleansing, it's considered a blood purifier and helps with lymphatic congestion​
- Yellow Dock: Another herb that stimulates bile production and supports liver detoxification​
- Green Tea / Matcha: Rich in antioxidants, studies suggest it can be helpful for NAFLD, reducing markers of liver damage. <#1261145108867452958> 

- Garlic: Linked to a lower risk of NAFLD, it can improve liver fat accumulation and reduce risk factors for liver disease​

- Red Clover: Supports liver detoxification and is considered a blood purifier, aiding in overall liver function​
- Ginger: Contains compounds that protect the liver from inflammation and cellular damage, and may be beneficial for NAFLD​
- Ginseng: Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect liver cells and aid in detoxification​
- Licorice Root: Used in traditional Chinese medicine for digestive and liver disorders, it helps in managing fatty liver disease​
- Danshen: This traditional Chinese herb is known for its effects on liver function and may reduce blood levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, helping prevent fat accumulation in the liver​
- Astragalus Root: Used in traditional Chinese medicine to enhance liver function, it may reduce inflammation associated with fatty liver disease​
- Ginkgo Biloba: Used in traditional Chinese medicine, it helps eliminate toxins and enhances the liver’s capacity to cleanse the blood​

There was a significant correlation between serum level of ALP and the extent of acne (non-inflammatory acne lesions and total acne lesions).

Support for the connection between acne and decreased liver function, particularly through the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant.

PNPLA3 rs738409 is associated with liver dysfunction:
> The rs738409-G allele has previously been reported as associated with an increased risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related cirrhosis and hepatic steatosis, as well as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, most likely through a gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism.

PNPLA3 rs738409-G is associated with decreased risk of acne:
> In addition, the meta-PheWAS revealed novel significant associations between the rs738409-G GOF allele and decreased risk for acne (OR 23andMe = 0.90, P23andMe = 1.5 × 10−11; Pmeta_v2 = 7.3 × 10−12).

PNPLA3 rs738409-G is associated with changes in lipid metabolism (which could link liver function and acne):
> Our meta-PheWAS further revealed significant associations between rs738409-G and decreased risk for high cholesterol (ORmeta = 0.96, Pmeta = 1.6 × 10−7; Pmeta_v2 = 1.1 × 10−8) and the intake of cholesterol-lowering medications (OR23andMe = 0.97, P23andMe = 2 × 10−4; Pmeta_v2 = 2.8 × 10−5), consistent with recent results from the lipids exome chip study describing a significant association of rs738409-G with decreased LDL levels.
