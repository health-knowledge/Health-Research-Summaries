# Stress - Lack of exercise

Lack of exercise can lead to decreased blood circulation, increased stress, and hormonal imbalances, all of which can contribute to acne breakouts.

It's recommended to perform both cardio, as well as resistance training, rather than just one type of exercise:

A systematic review and network meta-analysis by Pan et al. (2018) in The International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity indicated that combined aerobic and resistance training showed more pronounced improvement in HbA1c levels compared to either exercise alone.
A study by Sigal et al. (2007) in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a combined aerobic exercise and resistance training program led to a better reduction in hemoglobin A1c values than either exercise type alone. This suggests a synergistic effect of combining both types of exercise on glycemic control.
