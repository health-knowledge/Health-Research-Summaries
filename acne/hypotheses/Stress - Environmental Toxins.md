# Stress - Environmental Toxins

### Key Environmental Toxins
- Endocrine Disruptors: Chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), found in plastics, can mimic or interfere with the body's hormones, particularly estrogen and testosterone. This interference can exacerbate or trigger acne by promoting oil production and inflammation. Can leach into food and beverages, especially when containers are heated or damaged.
  - Non-stick cookware coated with PFAS can release these chemicals into food, especially when heated to high temperatures.
- Air Pollution: Particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in polluted air can penetrate the skin or be inhaled, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation, which exacerbate acne.

- Heavy Metals: Lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be found in contaminated water, #"Minimize foods high in heavy metals" , and even some skincare products, can disrupt hormonal activity and contribute to skin inflammation and acne.

- Pesticides/herbicides: Exposure to certain pesticides through diet or environment can disrupt endocrine function, affecting hormonal balance and potentially leading to acne flare-ups.
- Antibiotics: conventionally raised animal products may contain antibiotics
- Mold and mycotoxins

### Managing Exposure
- Use Air Purifiers: To reduce indoor air pollution.
- Choose Clean Beauty Products: Opt for skincare and cosmetics free from phthalates, BPA, and other harmful chemicals.
- Eat Organic: When possible, choose organic foods to reduce exposure to pesticides, antibiotics, as well as fat soluble toxins.
- Avoid Plastic: Especially for food storage, chopping boards and water bottles, to minimize exposure to BPA and phthalates.
- Avoid synthetic bedding and clothing
- Filter your tap water: #"Fluoride theory"

> The median levels of total BPA were significantly higher in the acne group compared with the control group (7.94 (4.69-20.32) vs. 5.62 (1.52-21.05) µg/g creatinine, respectively; p = 0.04)). The acne severity was positively associated with the BPA values (p = 0.00 rs = 0.534).
