# Organs - Decreased Gallbladder Function

People who had all three conditions (acne + Demodex mites + gallbladder issues) showed significantly more abnormal blood cells compared to those with just acne or acne + Demodex

## Frequency

- 44% of acne patients had gallbladder dysfunction
- The rate was higher in more severe acne cases:
 * Mild acne: 41.5% had gallbladder issues 
 * Moderate acne: 53.8% had gallbladder issues
## Possible Connection

- The researchers suggest one potential mechanism: "insufficient bile acid production as a result of decreased gallbladder function" might affect acne

Compounds that may help with bile composition / gallstone prevention:
- Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA): While not strictly a dietary compound, this naturally occurring bile acid has been used medically to dissolve certain types of gallstones.
- TUDCA: Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is a taurine conjugated form of UDCA with higher hydrophility.
- Choline
- Lecithin: This mixture of phospholipids, primarily composed of phosphatidylcholine, has shown promise in reducing cholesterol saturation in bile and potentially preventing gallstone formation.
- Milk Thistle: https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1260494342053691414
- Plant sterols: These compounds may help reduce cholesterol absorption and bile saturation, potentially preventing gallstone formation.
- Omega-3 fatty acids: These have shown potential in reducing cholesterol saturation in bile and preventing gallstone formation in some animal studies.
- Vitamin C: Studies have suggested that vitamin C can help break down cholesterol gallstones in animal models.
- Curcumin: Found in turmeric, curcumin has shown anti-inflammatory and choleretic effects that may help prevent gallstone formation in animal models. https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1268511942612619378
- Caffeine: Some studies have suggested that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of gallstone formation in humans. Also see acne and caffeine info https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1267409641566896160

- Artichoke

Liver health and bile composition:

liver damage in patients with metabolic syndrome leads to impaired bile micelle production, characterized by high cholesterol and low phospholipid levels, which increases bile lithogenicity and contributes to elevated cholesterol bile saturation and gallbladder pathology.
