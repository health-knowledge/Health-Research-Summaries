## Steaming:

Pros:
- Preserves water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C) better than boiling

Cons:
- May not make fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) as bioavailable as other cooking methods
- Doesn't reduce lectins or phytic acid in foods, which can interfere with nutrient absorption

Underlying acne issues addressed: Nutrient preservation

## Grilling:

Pros:
- High heat can destroy some harmful bacteria

Cons:
- Charring produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which may increase inflammation and oxidative stress. See Seppo Pussa's post about AGEs here: https://acneeinstein.com/cfl/dietary-advanced-glycation-end-products/
- May lead to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), potentially carcinogenic

Underlying acne issues addressed: May increase inflammation

## Baking:

Pros:
- Can make certain nutrients more bioavailable (e.g., lycopene in tomatoes)

Cons:
- Extended high-heat baking can reduce some heat-sensitive nutrients

## Boiling:

Pros:
- Can reduce glycemic index of some foods
- Effective for reducing lectins in beans and legumes

Cons:
- Can lead to significant loss of water-soluble vitamins
- May reduce flavor, leading to increased use of salt or other additives

Underlying acne issues addressed: Glycemic control, reducing anti-nutrients

## Blanching:

Pros:
- Preserves nutrients better than full cooking
- Can remove surface dirt and bacteria
- Helps retain color and texture in vegetables

Cons:
- Still results in some nutrient loss, particularly water-soluble vitamins
- May not be sufficient to make certain nutrients bioavailable

Underlying acne issues addressed: Nutrient preservation, food safety

## Juicing:

Pros:
- Concentrates certain nutrients, particularly antioxidants
- Easier absorption of some nutrients due to breakdown of plant cell walls

Cons:
- Removes fiber, which is important for gut health and controlling blood sugar
- Can concentrate sugars, potentially spiking insulin levels

Underlying acne issues addressed: Nutrient density, but may impact glycemic control and gut health

## Blending:

Pros:
- Retains fiber, supporting gut health and blood sugar control
- Breaks down plant cell walls, potentially increasing nutrient bioavailability
- Can make it easier to consume a variety of skin-supporting foods

Cons:
- May oxidize some nutrients due to exposure to air
- Can make it easy to overconsume calories if not careful

Underlying acne issues addressed: Gut health, nutrient absorption, glycemic control

## Sprouting:

Pros:
- Increases nutrient content, particularly B vitamins and vitamin C
- Reduces phytic acid, potentially improving mineral absorption
- May increase enzyme content, aiding digestion

Cons:
- Can increase risk of foodborne illness if not done properly
- May not be suitable for all seeds or legumes

Underlying acne issues addressed: Nutrient deficiencies, mineral absorption

## Soaking:

Pros:
- Reduces phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors, improving nutrient absorption
- Can make foods easier to digest
- May reduce cooking time, preserving more nutrients

Cons:
- Can lead to some nutrient loss in the soaking water
- Requires planning ahead

Underlying acne issues addressed: Nutrient absorption, digestive health

## Fermentation:

Pros:
- Increases probiotics, potentially improving gut health and reducing systemic inflammation
- May enhance nutrient absorption, particularly B vitamins and minerals
- Can lower glycemic index of some foods

Cons:
- Some fermented foods are high in histamines, which may trigger acne in sensitive individuals

Underlying acne issues addressed: Gut health, inflammation, nutrient deficiencies

## Raw food preparation:

Pros:
- Preserves heat-sensitive nutrients like vitamin C and some B vitamins
- Retains natural enzymes that may aid digestion
- Often lower in AGEs compared to cooked foods

Cons:
- Some nutrients are less bioavailable in raw form (e.g., lycopene in tomatoes)
- May contain more anti-nutrients like phytic acid
- Higher risk of foodborne illness if not handled properly
