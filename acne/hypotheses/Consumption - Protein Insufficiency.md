# Consumption - Protein Insufficiency

"A significant number of subjects (68.4%) were taking less than half of the recommended daily allowance of proteins and faced problems like hair fall, acne, pigmentation, vitiligo, hirsutism, melasma, and premature aging. "

Cysteine (an amino acid) insufficiency may contribute to acne by reducing the body's ability to produce glutathione (see https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1269559943321620580), an important antioxidant that helps combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the skin. This deficiency could lead to increased vulnerability to acne-causing factors, while supplementation with cysteine or precursor NAC may help restore balance and improve skin health in some individuals. <#1263759262723608697>

# Impaired metabolism of branched-chain amino acids and tryptophan
- "Serum levels of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine were significantly higher in the cicatricial acne group (p: <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, respectively) and in the non-cicatricial acne group (p: 0.039, 0.045, 0.001, respectively) compared to healthy subjects. There were also significant positive correlations between the levels of these amino acids and global acne scores (p = 0.048, r = 0.255, p = 0.006, r = 0.354, p = 0.017, r = 0.307, respectively) and scar scores (p = 0.032, r = 0.392, p = 0.021, r = 0.424, p = 0.018, r = 0.427, respectively). Serum tryptophan levels were significantly lower in both scatricial and non-scatricial acne groups compared to healthy subjects (p = 0.033 and < 0.001, respectively)."

- "In summary, our study suggests that the metabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids and other amino acids such as tryptophan and glutamine may play a role in acne pathogenesis and acne scarring."
