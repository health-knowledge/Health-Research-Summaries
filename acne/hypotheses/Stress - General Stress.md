# Stress - General Stress

High stress levels can trigger acne breakouts. Supplementing with natural herbs in the short term such as ashwagandha, L-theanine (found in tea),which is shown to help the body deal with stress, could help with this.

There is strong evidence supporting the relationship between stress and insulin resistance <#1179956411858427954> . Stress impairs glucose homeostasis through at least six molecular pathways, suggesting that stress can be an upstream event for insulin resistance. This relationship is partly due to the prevalence of diabetes being higher among individuals with a stressful lifestyle, although the underlying mechanisms are complex and multifaceted.

# Stress associations with acne

"The study suggests a significant association between stress and severity of acne papulopustulosa, especially in males. Increased acne severity associated with stress may result from factors other than sebum quantity. "

Yosipovitch, Gil et al. “Study of psychological stress, sebum production and acne vulgaris in adolescents.” Acta dermato-venereologica vol. 87,2 (2007): 135-9. doi:10.2340/00015555-0231

"Conclusions  Patients with acne may experience worsening of the disease during examinations. Furthermore, changes in acne severity correlate highly with increasing stress, suggesting that emotional stress from external sources may have a significant influence on acne."

"This study shows that patients with acne have higher levels of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, self-reported stress, anxiety sensitivity, and disability, and a greater prevalence of type D personality, than healthy controls"

# Substance P as psychological stress biomarker in acne
"There was a correlation between stress scale and serum substance P level in acne vulgaris."

"Results
There was no statistically significant difference between the severity of acne and the intensity of stress. Acne patients presented a higher average scSP than the controls. No statistically significant correlation was observed between the severity of acne and scSP; however, the intensity of stress correlated with scSP in the control group. The evaluation of methods of coping with stress showed significantly higher rate for the avoidance-oriented coping among acne patients."

# BDNF as psychological stress biomarker in acne

"Conclusion
Patients with acne are at a high risk to develop chronic stress, anxiety, and depression. BDNF is a good predictor for assessment of chronic stress in such patients."

# Alpha casein hydrolysate reduced stress, but not acne
This open-label study compared standard acne treatment alone to standard treatment plus Lactium, a milk protein supplement, in patients with moderate-to-severe acne. Over 12 weeks, both groups showed significant reductions in acne lesions, with no statistically significant difference between groups. While the Lactium group demonstrated greater stress reduction, this did not translate to superior acne outcomes. The lack of a placebo control and the similar acne improvements in both groups suggest that the standard treatment, rather than stress reduction or Lactium supplementation, was likely responsible for the observed acne improvements.

# Stress reduction trial on acne
"Treatment consisted of 12 sessions over six weeks and resulted in a significant reduction in acne severity as compared to the attention-comparison and medical control groups. Treatment group patients continuing home practice until follow-up maintained their gains, whereas those who discontinued failed to maintain gains. "
