# Consumption - Poor Gut Health, Leaky Gut, Intestinal Permeability

Imbalances in gut bacteria can affect your skin.

"In conclusion, patients with acne vulgaris have gut microbial dysbiosis; further study is needed to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acne. "
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756631/

"We identified links between acne vulgaris and changes of gut microbiota. At the phylum level, Actinobacteria (0.89% in acne patients and 2.84% in normal controls, P = 0.004) was decreased and Proteobacteria (8.35% in acne patients and 7.01% in normal controls, P = 0.031) was increased. At the genus level, Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Coprobacillus, Lactobacillus and Allobaculum were all decreased."

"Compared with healthy controls, the men had a lower abundance of 18 microbes such as Butyricicoccus, Clostridium sensu stricto, Faecalibaculum, Bacillus, Lactococcus, Blautia, Clostridiales, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, Ruminococcus at genus level. However, the female patients only showed increased Clostridium sensu stricto and declined Oscillibacter and Odoribacterin. Additionally, the disordered metabolism of fatty acids was identified in male patients, while the dysbiosis of amino acids metabolism in female ones."

This study identified gut microbes and blood metabolites that are causally associated with acne. A potential causal relationship between gut microbes and blood metabolites was obtained via mediation analysis.

- Do elimination diet to find food allergens or sensitivities. Start with paleo, then keto (low/no carb), then carnivore (more restrictive variant of keto) if issues still persist. Use these elimination diets as short term tools. Use cronometer to ensure you're getting vital nutrients.
 - Incorporate foods that promote gut health, such as bone broth (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22629114/), fermented foods (like raw sauerkraut, kimchi, and [raw A2/goat kefir](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1358325181868802078)).

# H. Pylori infection
"Conclusion: The patients with severe AV had higher levels of fecal H pylori antigen and serum H pylori antibody as compared to the patients with mild and moderate AV and with healthy controls. The indicators of H pylori infection were positively correlated with the severity and duration of AV."
Saleh, Ramadan et al. “High levels of Helicobacter pylori antigens and antibodies in patients with severe acne vulgaris.” Journal of cosmetic dermatology vol. 19,12 (2020): 3291-3295. doi:10.1111/jocd.13409

"Conclusion: The results of this investigation showed a favorable correlation between H. pylori infection and both AV severity and global score. The H. pylori antigen has a modest sensitivity and specificity, making it capable of distinguishing between cases and control groups. "
Abd elhalem, E., Youssef, Y., Abdel Twab, H. E., & El Dakrory, F. (2024). Association of Acne Vulgaris and Helicobacter pylori Infection: A Case-control Study. Egyptian Journal of Medical Microbiology, 33(3), 43-48. doi: 10.21608/ejmm.2024.292614.1252

"In our study the number of AV involved sites and severity of AV were positively correlated with the rates of H. pylori antigen in stool and H. pylori antibody in serum. The observations of our study indicate that the prevalence rate of H. pylori infection in patients of AV is high and H. pylori infection may be related to increasing the severity of AV."
"antibiotics that are known to be effective in AV such as metronidazole, tetracycline, and doxycycline, are also effective against H. pylori infection. Such observation may also suggest a possible role of H. pylori infection, in the pathogenesis of AV"

# H. Pylori infection 2
"Results: There were statistically significant increase in anti-Helicobacter immunoglobulin G index in severe acne group (P<0.001), positive correlation between antibody index and acne score (P=0.02), and **statistically significant decrease in total lesion count after triple therapy in all groups** (P=0.002, 0.04, 0.001), respectively."

# Vitamin A and leaky gut connection
"For 30 children, performance on the lactulose/mannitol test, a test commonly used to assess intestinal barrier function, was inversely correlated (P=.012) with serum retinol concentrations"
Quadro, L et al. “Retinol and retinol-binding protein: gut integrity and circulating immunoglobulins.” The Journal of infectious diseases vol. 182 Suppl 1 (2000): S97-S102. doi:10.1086/315920

**Although, vitamin A supplementation didn't show intestinal permability improvements in a separate study, it did help with parasitic infections:**
> The lactulose:mannitol ratio did not change during the same time of follow-up (P > 0.05).

> Total intestinal parasitic, specifically new, infections were significantly lower in the vitamin A treatment compared with control group; these were accounted for entirely by significantly fewer new Giardia infections in the vitamin A treatment group

Lima, Aldo A M et al. “Effects of vitamin A supplementation on intestinal barrier function, growth, total parasitic, and specific Giardia spp infections in Brazilian children: a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.” Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition vol. 50,3 (2010): 309-15. doi:10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a96489
**Possible reasons for no improvements:
- Normal baseline permeability: As the baseline lactulose:mannitol ratios were considered normal for that population, there might have been limited room for improvement.
- The lack of effect on intestinal permeability could be due to most children already having sufficient vitamin A levels**

# Leaky gut
> The inference of these results is that circulating endotoxins derived from gut microbes is not an uncommon feature of acne vulgaris, and one indicating that intestinal permeability is a potential issue for a sizable group of acne patients

> Results: In the acne group, the mean blood zonulin level was significantly higher than in the control group (195.54 ± 49.05 ng/mL vs. 158.45 ± 85.07 ng/mL, p = 0.001). Additionally, milk and high glycemic index food consumption were significantly higher in the acne group.

## Skin candida and acne
> Fungi of the Candida genus were found at (3.21 ±0.58)x10^4 in acne patients, compared to (1.00 ±0.20)x10^4 in the control group.

This indicates the levels of Candida were about 3 times higher in the acne patients compared to the healthy controls. The difference was statistically significant (marked with an asterisk in Table 1).
Additionally, the text notes that in 13 (15.29±3.90%) of acne patients, Candida fungi were cultured from skin samples, while these were not found in any of the control group subjects.
