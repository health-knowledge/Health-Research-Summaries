# Consumption - Lack of Certain Nutrients

Deficiencies in nutrients could be implicated with acne due to various effects on metabolism. [Gut issues](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179948878267678832) and <#1179978160717172776>  could result in these vitamins not being absorbed properly from food.

## Essential fatty acids - specifically Omega3 (but be careful consuming too much)
I suggest getting these from animal sources, as plant based sources of omega3 have a low conversion efficiency.

## Vitamin D

"Result: From a total of 401 studies, 10 studies met the criteria. Almost all studies (8 of 10) revealed lower serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels as the acne severity progresses, although 2 of them were not statistically significant."
