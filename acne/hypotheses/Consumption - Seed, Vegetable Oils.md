# Consumption - Seed, Vegetable Oils

Processed seed oils ("greasy foods"), often high in omega-6 fatty acids and trans fats, can contribute to inflammation in the body, a factor known to exacerbate acne. Additionally, these oils can alter the composition of sebum, potentially leading to clogged pores and increased acne breakouts.

- High Levels of Omega-6 Fatty Acids: Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids. These types of fats, when consumed in large amounts, can lead to inflammation within the body, including the skin. Inflammation is a known aggravator of acne​​​. 
- Altering Sebum Composition: There is some evidence suggesting that the consumption of certain seed oils can change the composition of sebum produced by the skin. For example, a 2014 study found that the consumption of sunflower seeds was positively correlated with acne.
- Consumption vs. Topical Use: While some seed oils might have beneficial anti-inflammatory properties when used topically, their consumption can lead to different results. For instance, linoleic acid in sunflower seed oil might be beneficial topically, but consuming sunflower seeds showed a positive correlation with acne​.
- Imbalance in Omega-6 and Omega-3 Ratio: The typical American diet already has an excess of omega-6 fatty acids compared to omega-3 fatty acids. This imbalance can lead to systemic inflammation, which in turn can exacerbate acne and other skin issues​.

Seed oils are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-6 fatty acids. PUFAs are more prone to oxidation compared to saturated and monounsaturated fats. The increased lipid peroxidation associated with PUFAs can lead to higher levels of MDA, a marker of oxidative stress.

The significant decrease in the antioxidant enzyme biomarkers, as well as the significant increase in the lipid peroxidation marker, indicates the compromised oxidant–antioxidant balance in patients with acne vulgaris

Serum analysis showed significantly higher levels of carbonyl contents, malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO, in acne patients compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). Interestingly, not only there were an increased number of subjects positive for carbonyl contents, but also the levels of these oxidants were significantly increased with the increase of the disease activity (P < 0.05). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the levels of carbonyl contents and the GAGS scores (r = 0.341, r = 0.355, and r = 0.299, respectively). Furthermore, sera from acne patients had lower levels of SOD and GSH compared with healthy control sera.

> In patients with acne, the balance between oxidants and antioxidants is altered. The most commonly used markers to assess OS in acne were MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation, and the antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD, which were measured in blood samples (serum/plasma/erythrocytes).

Integrated targeted serum metabolomic profile and its association with gender, age, disease severity, and pattern identification in acne:

Male subgroup
No significant differences were noted in androgens, serum lipids, EAAs, and cytokines. Two NEAAs and sum of NEAAs were significantly lower in the acne group (Table 4 and Fig 1).

Female subgroup
No significant differences were found in the cytokines. Among androgens, DHEA-S, and among serum lipids, palmitic acid were significantly higher in the acne group. Three EAAs and sum of EAAs were significantly lower, while one NEAA and one of the other AAs were significantly higher in the acne group (Table 4 and Fig 1).

Adolescent subgroup
No significant differences were observed in EAAs and cytokines. Among androgens, DHEA-S, and among serum lipids, **linoleic and oleic acids**, were significantly higher in the acne group. One NEAA was significantly lower in the acne group (Table 4 and Fig 1).

Adult subgroup
No significant differences were found in androgens, serum lipids, and cytokines. Five EAAs, two NEAA, sum of EAAs, and sum of NEAAs significantly lower, while two NEAAs were significantly higher in the acne group (Table 4 and Fig 1).

> Regarding the comparison of MDA between mild acne vulgaris cases, severe cases and control, the results were highly statistically significant (p value <0.01) as mean MDA was significantly lower among mild acne vulgaris ( 1.3±0.37 ) than severe cases (3.6±0.89), while MDA was significantly higher among mild and severe cases than among control

Since their introduction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seed oils have faced health and stability concerns, leading to numerous modifications, though controversies like the effects of linoleic acid persist. Here’s a timeline of key changes:

Early Use (1800s–1900s)
    •    Cottonseed and Soybean Oil: Introduced for affordability; early refining left impurities.

Issues Discovered (1920s–1970s)
1.    Erucic Acid (1970s): Linked to heart issues in rapeseed oil; led to canola oil (low-erucic).
2.    Gossypol (1920s): Toxic pigment in cottonseed oil; removed through refining.

Major Changes (1950s–2000s)
3.    Trans Fats (1950s–2000s): Harmful trans fats from partial hydrogenation; replaced by full hydrogenation, interesterification, and stable oils.
4.    Oxidation (1980s): Polyunsaturated fats caused rancidity; bred high-oleic varieties.
5. Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) (mid-20th century–present): A modified vegetable oil used as an emulsifier in citrus-flavored beverages to keep flavor oils evenly suspended. Health concerns over bromine accumulation have led to regulatory scrutiny and the voluntary removal of BVO from many products.

Modern Refinements (2000s–Present)
5.    Contaminants: Improved refining to remove impurities.
6.    Rancidity: Antioxidants added to extend shelf life.

Current Concerns
    •    Linoleic Acid: Debated for its potential link to inflammation.
    •    Health Impacts: Long-term effects of seed oil consumption remain uncertain.

## omega6:omega3 ratio
> Our study indicates that high DHA levels and their ratios to total fatty acids have causal protective effects against acne, while high LA levels and omega-6: omega-3 ratio are associated with increased acne risk. This association was largely attributable to the influence of genetic variants related to FADS1.
