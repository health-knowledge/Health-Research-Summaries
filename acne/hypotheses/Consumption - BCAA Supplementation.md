# Consumption - BCAA Supplementation

Markers Affected by BCAAs
1. Hormonal Assessments
    Cortisol:
        Effect: BCAA supplementation may reduce exercise-induced cortisol levels, potentially lowering stress-related catabolism (protein breakdown).

    Growth Hormone (GH):
        Effect: BCAAs, particularly leucine, may acutely stimulate growth hormone release during exercise by activating the mTOR pathway.

    Insulin:
        Effect: BCAAs can stimulate insulin secretion, especially leucine, enhancing muscle protein synthesis post-exercise.

2. Blood Sugar and Insulin Sensitivity
    Fasting Insulin:
        Effect: Increased insulin secretion due to BCAA intake may benefit muscle recovery but could be a concern for individuals with insulin resistance.

    Glucose Metabolism:
        Effect: Elevated circulating BCAAs have been associated with insulin resistance in some studies, though causality is not established.

3. Inflammation Markers
    C-Reactive Protein (CRP):
        Effect: BCAA supplementation may reduce CRP levels, indicating a potential decrease in systemic inflammation and improved recovery.

4. Liver Function Tests
    Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST):
        Effect: In individuals with liver dysfunction, BCAAs may help improve liver enzyme levels and overall liver function.

5. Gut Health
    Intestinal Permeability (Leaky Gut):
        Effect: BCAAs might enhance gut barrier function, potentially reducing intestinal permeability and supporting gut health.

6. Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1):
    Effect: Activation of the mTOR pathway by leucine could influence IGF-1 levels, though significant changes due to BCAAs are not well-established.
