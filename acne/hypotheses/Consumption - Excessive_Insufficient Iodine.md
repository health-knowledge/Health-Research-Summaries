# Consumption - Excessive/Insufficient Iodine

There are concerns about excess intake, particularly from supplements such as iodized salt or foods high in iodine such as kelp. One of the reasons behind this theory is due to the effects on the thyroid (see https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179956298041807009 for more info on thyroid connection):
"In a study of >200 Chinese adults, subclinical hypothyroidism was more common in those supplemented with a 400 Î¼g iodine tablet than in those given placebo" - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976240/

Another reason for this concern is due to existing links between diary and acne:
"The authors hypothesize that this association may be caused by the presence of hormones and bioactive molecules in milk. Another hypothesis to help explain this association is that the iodine content of milk may also be playing a role in the development of the acne. It is well established that iodine intake can exacerbate acne" - https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(05)02097-9/fulltext
Although the claim above is based on topical application of iodine, rather than dietary.
The above was also refuted in the case of dairy, but there is still a concern for foods such as kelp, although this may present differently from acne vulgaris - https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)01198-4/fulltext#back-bib1

Interestingly: "large study that refuted the acne-iodine connection found the lowest rates of acne were among adolescents consuming the greatest amounts of fish and seafood. In fact, each of the primary signs of acne, oily skin, comedones, papules, pustules, and acne cysts were significantly lower among teenagers consuming a diet higher in saltwater fish and seafood" - https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01261-3/fulltext#%20

From a Russian study:
- The study was conducted in the Chernivtsi region, which is known to have natural iodine deficiency.
- They studied 146 acne vulgaris patients aged 18-29 years old living in this iodine-deficient region.
- More than half (59.6%) of these acne patients were found to have various changes in thyroid function, mostly subclinical, as assessed by:
  - Serum levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4, TSH) using radioimmunoassay
  - Sonographic examination of the thyroid gland
- The thyroid dysfunction was more frequently observed in patients with moderate to severe acne compared to those with mild acne.
- Patients with detected thyroid abnormalities were prescribed appropriate thyroid medications (L-thyroxine for hypothyroidism, anti-thyroid drugs for hyperthyroidism, iodine preparations for nodule formation) by an endocrinologist as part of their individualized treatment plan.

"A total of seven cases of acne of the face, all in women past the "acne age," have been observed following the prolonged use of iodized salt"
