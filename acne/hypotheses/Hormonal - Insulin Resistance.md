Some other things to consider regarding blood sugar management:
## Too Much Food In One Sitting
can lead to hormonal fluctuations, increased blood sugar levels, and inflammation, all of which can contribute to acne breakouts. Intermittent fasting, extended water fasts, and not eating big meals before bed could help.
## Smoothies 
This is related to the above. Avoid blending lots of high glycemic fruits/veg into smoothies as this can break the fiber which may result in sugar being absorbed more quickly.

## Caloric intake timing
“In lean PCOS women, a high caloric intake at breakfast with reduced intake at dinner results in improved insulin sensitivity indices and reduced cytochrome P450c17α activity, which ameliorates hyperandrogenism and improves ovulation rate.”

While fasting blood glucose levels were not different between the groups (p > 0.05, 82.91 ±9.76 vs. 80.26 ±8.33), the fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p < 0.001, 14.01 ±11.94 vs. 9.12 ±3.53). Additionally, there was a highly significant difference between the patient and control groups in terms of HOMA values (p < 0.001, 2.87 ±2.56 vs. 1.63 ±0.65)

"Association of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 gene polymorphisms with plasma levels of IGF-1 and acne severity" found that mean plasma IGF-1 levels were significantly higher in acne cases compared to non-acne controls. Plasma IGF-1 levels positively correlated with the severity of acne. Individuals with certain IGF-1 gene polymorphisms had a higher risk of acne and more severe grades of acne (Rahaman et al., 2016, Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology).

A positive association was observed between the severity of acne and insulin resistance syndrome, obesity, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism (p < 0.05). Risk analysis indicated a significantly higher risk (RR > 1, 95% CI RR > 1, p < 0.001) of developing moderate and severe acne in the presence of these preconditions

## Proposed: Insulin index instead of glycemic index
> In recent studies, apart from the consumption frequency of foodstuffs with high glycemic index values, the consumption frequency of certain foodstuffs with low glycemic index value was also found to be high in AV patients. In this regard, we found that acne is triggered by foodstuff such as feta, cola, cheese, and peanut in which insulin index value was higher than glycemic index value. This result may suggest that insulin index may be used as another marker for AV-triggering foodstuffs
