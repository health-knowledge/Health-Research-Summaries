# External Cleanliness - Poor Hygiene

Not washing your face enough, particularly after workouts, can lead to a buildup of sweat, oil, and dirt on your skin, which can clog pores and cause acne.

Although this is usually more about what is getting on your face rather than how often you wash.

Interestingly, sweat from working out showed no statistically significant differences in acne:

TODO: link between excessive sweating and thyroid/metabolism, high carb diets - could this explain the sweat-acne connection?
