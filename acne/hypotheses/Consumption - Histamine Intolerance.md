# Consumption - Histamine Intolerance

Histamine can influence acne by triggering inflammatory responses in the skin, which can exacerbate acne symptoms.

Dietary Adjustments: Histamine levels are influenced by diet. Foods high in histamine or that release histamine, like aged cheeses, fermented foods, alcohol, and processed meats, might need to be reduced or eliminated. A low-histamine diet can help identify triggers.

[Gut Health](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179948878267678832 ): Improving gut health is crucial since histamine is partially broken down in the gut. Probiotics, particularly strains that may help degrade histamine, could be beneficial. Also, addressing underlying gut issues like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or leaky gut syndrome can be important.

Enzyme Support: Some people benefit from supplements like DAO (diamine oxidase), the enzyme that breaks down histamine in foods. Taking it before meals can help reduce symptoms.

Nutritional Support: Certain nutrients like vitamin C, B6, and magnesium can support the body's natural ability to break down histamine.

The following suggests histamines may play a role in acne

> Result At week 12, compared to isotretinoin only group, combination of isotretinoin and levocetirizine group showed more statistically significant decrease in score of global acne grading system (51.0 vs. 38.5%) and acne lesion counts (non-inflammatory lesion: 63.2 vs. 44.5%; inflammatory lesions: 75.9 vs. 62.7%; total lesions: 66.07 vs. 48.7%; all p< 0.05). Flaring up of acne occurred less frequently and adverse effects were more tolerable in levocetirizine group. Conclusion Use of antihistamine with isotretinoin provides synergic effect while minimizing the side effect of isotretinoin and greater clearance of the lesion and scars.

> **Cimetidine, a histamine H2 antagonist**, seems to have anti-androgenic activity. 22 young women were studied during follicular phase prior to and after a 3 month period of treatment with cimetidine (1,200 mg daily). Three month treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease of seborrheic index (p less than 10(-4)) and casual level (p less than 10(-4)). Testosterone level, TeBG binding capacity and free testosterone were unaffected by the treatment. **Cimetidine decrease sebum secretion without change in androgen parameters.**

> Conclusion For treating moderate acne vulgaris, combining oral Isotretinoin with desloratadine augments the curative effect of isotretinoin as compared to using isotretinoin only.
