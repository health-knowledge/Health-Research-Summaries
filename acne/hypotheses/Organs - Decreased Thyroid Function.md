# Organs - Decreased Thyroid Function

Thyroid issues can alter hormone levels and metabolic processes, potentially exacerbating skin oil production and inflammation, leading to acne.

The results of this study indicate an association between the changes in the thyroid function, presence of antithyroid antibodies, and severity of acne in young patients. Assessing the thyroid antibodies in adult patients with acne should be considered by clinicians, because positive results lead to treating a higher number of subjects, as it is indicated by the current study outcomes.

## Either anti-TG or anti-TPO
> There was a statistically significant difference between the groups for positive anti-TG (p = 0.023) and anti-TPO (p = 0.021) antibodies but not for presence of both (p = 0.098)

> Based on our findings we suggest thyroid autoantibody testing should be routine in women with post-adolescent acne, as positive results may signify a joint presentation qualifying endocrinological input.

## anti-TG antibodies but not anti-TPO
"There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.008) in the prevalence of positive anti-TG antibodies, with 25.2% of the acne group and 8.3% of the control group having elevated (> 40 U/mL) anti-TG levels, respectively. Adult women with acne had a statistically significant increased relative risk to have high levels of anti-TG in comparison with healthy controls (odds ratio 3.89, P = 0.011). This association was independent of age. Values for TSH, FT4, FT3, T4 and anti-TPO did not significantly differ between the two groups. No significant difference was found regarding the thyroid ultrasound findings. Although there was no significant difference between cases and controls regarding CRP levels, it is interesting that we observed a significant elevation in CRP in those acne patients who had positive antithyroglobulin antibodies."

## anti-TPO (2025)
> There were statistically significantly higher levels of TPO-Ab in acne vulgaris. Serum levels of TPO-Ab were positively correlated with the severity of the acne but it lacked statistical significance. The study will help early detection of thyroid disorder in AV patient and prevention of thyroid related comorbidities. We recommended the estimation of urinary iodine concentration along with serum hormone study

## autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism
"A positive association was observed between the severity of acne and insulin resistance syndrome, obesity, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism (p < 0.05). Risk analysis indicated a significantly higher risk (RR > 1, 95% CI RR > 1, p < 0.001) of developing moderate and severe acne in the presence of these preconditions"

## Hypothyroidism
"Results. It was found that acne in women occurs on a background of polycystic ovary syndrome — 27.77 %, atypical forms of congenital adrenal glands dysfunction — 22.12 %, hyperprolactinemia syndrome — 15.01 %, hypothyroidism — 6.32 %, diabetes mellitus type 2 — 6.32 %."

## Hypothyroidism
"Study was conducted in 111 patients of thyroid disorders. Spondylitis, asthma, **acne **cases were seen in hypothyroid patients whereas hypokalemic periodic paralysis, thyroid ophthalmopathy statistically significantly seen in hyperthyroid patients."

## No relationship between thyroid functions and postadolescent acne

"Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with postadolescent acne (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between patients with postadolescent acne and control subjects in triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, thyroid hormone profiles, and thyroid ultrasound scans. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased with postadolescent acne (P = 0.01)"

## FT4 and TSH associations with acne incidence - subclinical hypothyroidism?
"The level of serum free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were estimated. The study revealed significant lower levels of FT4 (p-0.02) and significant higher levels of TSH (p <0.001) of group A when compared with group B."
