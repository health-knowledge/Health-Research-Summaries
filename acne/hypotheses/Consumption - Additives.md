# Consumption - Additives

Check for any additives in your foods/drinks, even chewing gum. 

Emulsifiers, sweeteners (particularly artificial like sucralose and aspartame), nanoparticles, preservatives, and other chemicals may indirectly contribute acne through several mechanisms:

1. Inflammation: Some additives may promote systemic inflammation, which can exacerbate acne. For example:
   - Artificial sweeteners like aspartame
   - Preservatives such as sodium benzoate
   - Artificial colors and dyes

2. Hormonal disruption: Certain additives may interfere with hormone balance, potentially leading to increased sebum production:
   - Bovine growth hormone in dairy products
   - Synthetic preservatives like BHA and BHT

3. Gut microbiome alteration: Additives that negatively affect gut bacteria can indirectly impact skin health:

4. Insulin response: Additives that affect blood sugar levels may indirectly influence acne:
   - High fructose corn syrup
   - Refined sugars and starches used as fillers

5. Oxidative stress: Some additives may increase oxidative stress in the body:
   - Certain artificial preservatives
   - Synthetic antioxidants

6. Nutrient absorption: Additives that interfere with nutrient absorption could potentially impact skin health:
   - Certain emulsifiers and thickeners

# Gut effects
There is evidence that certain food additives may have negative effects on gut health and the intestinal lining. Here's an overview of some key points:

1. Emulsifiers:
Studies have shown that some emulsifiers like carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 can alter gut bacteria composition and potentially damage the mucus layer protecting the intestinal lining. A 2015 study in mice found these emulsifiers induced low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome.

2. Artificial sweeteners:
Research suggests artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame may disrupt the gut microbiome. A 2014 study in Nature found that artificial sweeteners altered gut bacteria in ways that could induce glucose intolerance.

3. Nanoparticles:
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles, used as a whitening agent (E171), have been shown in some studies to potentially damage intestinal cells and alter gut microbiota. A 2017 study in Scientific Reports found these nanoparticles could induce colonic inflammation in mice.

4. Preservatives:
Some preservatives like sodium benzoate have been associated with increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut") in animal studies. A 2016 study in the World Journal of Gastroenterology found sodium benzoate increased gut permeability in rats.

5. Glucose-fructose syrup:
High consumption of glucose-fructose syrup (also known as high-fructose corn syrup) has been linked to alterations in gut bacteria and increased intestinal permeability in some studies.
