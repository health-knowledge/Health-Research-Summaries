# Consumption - High Carb Diet

Consuming foods with a high glycemic load, such as white bread and pasta, can cause acne in some people. 

 - Excessive carb intake also depletes key nutrients such as magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, chromium, and B vitamins, which is implicated in acne. See <#1179948530878648430>
 - Note: fructose has a different pathway (needs to be processed by the liver first), but you should still watch out for fruits because excessive fructose is associated with higher risk of NAFLD.

 - Other acne pathways which are effected by carbs include: forms of gut dysbiosis (Candida overgrowth, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), Insulin resistance, IGF-1
 - If you're going to cut out carbs, make sure you're getting enough fats otherwise you'll feel depleted

## No improvements
Interestingly, another trial on glycemic index found no difference in acne between groups. In my opinion, this could potentially be because macronutrient distribution or fiber content was the same between both groups:
Reynolds, R. C., Lee, S., Choi, J. Y., Atkinson, F. S., Stockmann, K. S., Petocz, P., & Brand-Miller, J. C. (2010). Effect of the glycemic index of carbohydrates on Acne vulgaris. Nutrients, 2(10), 1060–1072. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu2101060

A study comparing low glycemic load diet plus benzoyl peroxide versus benzoyl peroxide alone for acne found no significant difference in acne improvement, despite metabolic benefits in the diet group:

In total, 82 (25.2%) participants were in the clinical acne group and 240 (74.5%) were in the reference group. There were 155 (48.1%) participants in the yin-PG and 167 (51.9%) in the yang-PG group. No association of diet and acne was found when the participants were considered as a homogenous group. 
In yin-PG, intake of foods from street stalls (P = 0.04) was significantly associated with a lower incidence of acne. 
In yang-PG, the intake of desserts (P = 0.04) and fresh fruit juices (P = 0.02) was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acne, whereas the intake of dairy and soy products (P = 0.04) was significantly associated with a lower incidence of acne.

## Low glycemic load diet
A low glycemic index and glycemic load diet decreased IGF-1 concentrations in adults with moderate to severe acne after 2 weeks, but did not significantly affect glucose, insulin, or IGFBP-3 concentrations or insulin resistance.

A significantly higher number of respondents with severe/moderate anxiety were convinced that acne breakouts were affected by diet (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.23−1.87, p < 0.001) and foods with a high glycemic index (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.23−1.94, p < 0.001).

## Mediterranean diet

Acne severity, IGF-1 levels affected by various acne treatments and diet (Mediterannean diet vs Western Diet):

## Non-Mediterranean diet (based on PREDIMED questionnaire) is associated with acne
"The results of the multivariate analysis showed PhA and PREDIMED score were the major determinants of GAGS score (p < 0.001)"

## Mediterranean diet score is protective against acne
“Logistic regression analysis showed that familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, and hypertension are strong risk factors for acne (AOR 8.79, 95% CI 1.67-46.22; 3.32, 95% CI 1.27-8.63; and 2.73, 95% CI 1.07-6.96, respectively), while the Mediterranean diet represents a protective factor (score ≥6, AOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.89).”

> Oily fish intake was found to be a protective factor for acne (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10–0.49, p < .001), and it was also observed that oily fish intake can reduce the level of fasting insulin by the IVW method (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98, p = .02). No causal relationship was identified between other types of meat intake and acne.
