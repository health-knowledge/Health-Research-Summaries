# Consumption - Creatine Supplements

Creatine may increase water retention and alter hormone levels, specifically DHT, potentially exacerbating acne in predisposed individuals.

Research on this is mixed…

## Testosterone and Cortisol Levels
Some studies have found that creatine supplementation does not significantly alter the levels of testosterone and cortisol in response to resistance training. For example, a study found that short-term creatine supplementation does not significantly affect the growth hormone, testosterone, and cortisol response to heavy resistance training (Eijnde & Hespel, 2001).

## Growth Hormone Secretion
"Conclusions: In resting conditions and at high dosages Cr enhances GH secretion, mimicking the response of strong exercise which also stimulates GH secretion. Acute body weight gain and strength increase observed after Cr supplementation should consider the indirect anabolic property of Cr."

## DHT
"After 7 days of creatine loading, or a further 14 days of creatine maintenance dose, serum T levels did not change. However, levels of DHT increased by 56% after 7 days of creatine loading and remained 40% above baseline after 14 days maintenance (P < 0.001). The ratio of DHT:T also increased by 36% after 7 days creatine supplementation and remained elevated by 22% after the maintenance dose (P < 0.01)."

## Hormones
Decreased:
- Total testosterone (TT):
"Total testosterone (TT) and the free androgen index (TT/SHBG) decreased in CrM and P, reaching a nadir at week 3"

- Free androgen index (FAI):
"The FAI was significantly decreased at week 1 and reached the lowest point at week 3."

- Insulin:
"Insulin was significantly depressed at week 1 (−24%) and drifted back toward baseline during weeks 2–4."


Increased:
- Cortisol (in the creatine group only):
"Cortisol significantly increased after week 1 in CrM (+29%), and returned to baseline at week 2."

- Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (showed a trend towards increase):
While not directly quoted, the study noted: "There were significant main time effects for total testosterone, free androgen index (FAI: total testosterone/SHBG), cortisol, and insulin, and a trend for SHBG (P<0.06)." The article also mentioned that SHBG "responded in an opposite direction" to total testosterone, indicating an increase.
### Hormones tested:
Total testosterone (TT), Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), Free androgen index (FAI, calculated as TT/SHBG), Free testosterone, Cortisol, Insulin, Growth hormone (GH), Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)

## IGF-1
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) and Muscle Anabolism: Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase the expression of mRNA for IGF-I and IGF-II in muscle, suggesting a potential mechanism by which creatine may facilitate muscle anabolism (Deldicque et al., 2005).

"These findings indicate that creatine supplementation during resistance-exercise training increases intramuscular IGF-I concentration in healthy men and women, independent of habitual dietary routine. "

## Acne as self reported side effect of creatine
"Fifty-one respondents (7.2%) who checked “other” provided responses that included “**acne**, heart problems, diarrhea, mood swings and sexual dysfunction.”"
