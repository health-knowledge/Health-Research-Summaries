# Hormonal - Orgasms

Although there are no studies directly linking orgasms to acne, hormonal fluctuations triggered by orgasms may potentially influence sebum production and inflammation, which are factors associated with acne development.

"Plasma prolactin substantially increased after orgasm, remained elevated over the remainder of the session, and was still raised 60 minutes after sexual arousal. In addition, sexual arousal also produced small increases in plasma LH and testosterone concentrations." [1]

"The study found that hyperprolactinemia, associated and nonassociated with adenoma, or pituitary microadenoma, can act as a primary factor in the development of acne" [2]

"These data suggest that PRL modulates the secretion of DHEA-S: an increase in plasma levels of PRL is correlated with elevated concentrations of DHEA-S, whereas a decrease in PRL is followed by a fall in DHEA-S. " [3]

"The results suggest that the increased PRL levels interfere with the conversion of T into biologically active DHT, as appears from the significant decrease in the ratio of DHT to T during Sulpiride treatment under HCG stimulation." [4]

For males, zinc lost in seminal fluid might be related, although the amount lost is quite small <#1179948530878648430>
