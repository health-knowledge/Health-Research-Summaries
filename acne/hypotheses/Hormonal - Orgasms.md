# Hormonal - Orgasms

## Hormones

Although there are no studies directly linking orgasms to acne, hormonal fluctuations triggered by orgasms may potentially influence sebum production and inflammation, which are factors associated with acne development.

"Plasma prolactin substantially increased after orgasm, remained elevated over the remainder of the session, and was still raised 60 minutes after sexual arousal. In addition, sexual arousal also produced small increases in plasma LH and testosterone concentrations." [1]

"The study found that hyperprolactinemia, associated and nonassociated with adenoma, or pituitary microadenoma, can act as a primary factor in the development of acne" [2]

"These data suggest that PRL modulates the secretion of DHEA-S: an increase in plasma levels of PRL is correlated with elevated concentrations of DHEA-S, whereas a decrease in PRL is followed by a fall in DHEA-S. " [3]

"The results suggest that the increased PRL levels interfere with the conversion of T into biologically active DHT, as appears from the significant decrease in the ratio of DHT to T during Sulpiride treatment under HCG stimulation." [4]

> "The plasma levels of all steroids were significantly increased after masturbation, whereas steroid levels remained unchanged in the control study." [5]

> "On the 7th day of abstinence, however, a clear peak of serum testosterone appeared, reaching 145.7% of the baseline ( P < 0.01)." [6]

## Zinc ([Consumption - Lack of certain nutrients](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179948530878648430/1208305080479125555))
For males, zinc lost in seminal fluid might be related, although the amount lost is quite small.

> The findings suggest that serum testosterone concentrations, seminal volume, and total seminal zinc loss per ejaculate are sensitive to short-term zinc depletion in young men.

## Spermatogenic Retinoid Competition

In males with marginal vitamin A status, the testes—due to their high, demand-driven use of retinoic acid (RA) to support continuous spermatogenesis—may act as a major sink for available retinoids. This preferential allocation of vitamin A metabolites to the testis could reduce RA availability for peripheral tissues, particularly the skin. Since RA is essential for keratinocyte differentiation, sebum regulation, and anti-inflammatory signaling, such a redistribution may impair cutaneous RA-dependent processes. In individuals predisposed to acne, this localized RA insufficiency could contribute to or exacerbate acne pathophysiology.

Caveats:
    •    This is currently a plausible but unproven mechanism. There are no human studies directly measuring tissue-specific RA levels in acne patients under marginal vitamin A conditions.
