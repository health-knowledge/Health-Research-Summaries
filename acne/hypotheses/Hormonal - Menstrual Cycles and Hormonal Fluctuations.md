# Hormonal - Menstrual Cycles and Hormonal Fluctuations

Some women report breakouts during specific times in their menstrual cycle. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Birth control may sometimes cause acne, and sometimes it may even temporarily fix it

"Conclusion: A significant number of adult women have perimenstrual acne symptoms. This study has proven to be useful in characterizing perimenstrual acne flare and is one of the first qualitative documentations of the presence and degree of this disorder."

## Relationship between birth control and acne, focusing on the mechanisms involved

1. Hormonal Mechanism:
Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) work by inhibiting the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, which leads to reduced androgen production. As one paper states, "The inhibition of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis induced by oral contraceptives is followed by reduced androgen production." Additionally, "Oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol, which has strong estrogenic activity, amplify the hypoandrogenic effect via estrogen-related stimulation of SHBG." (Use of oral contraceptives in the management of acne)

2. Effect on Sebum Production:
COCs can target sebum production, which is a key factor in acne development. As noted, "COCs can target sebum production and may also play a role in decreasing follicular hyperkeratinisation." (The role of combined oral contraceptives containing norgestimate for acne vulgaris treatment: a review)

3. Specific Hormonal Components:
Different progestins in birth control pills can have varying effects on acne. For instance, "EE-CPA also increases SHBG which, in turn, binds free circulating testosterone." (Hormonal therapy of acne) This binding of free testosterone can help reduce acne symptoms.

4. Efficacy:
Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of COCs in treating acne. One study reported, "At Month 6, there was a significantly greater reduction of total acne lesion in the EE/CMA group than EE/DRSP (72.2% vs 64.5%; = 0.009)." (A comparison of combined oral contraceptives containing chlormadinone acetate versus drospirenone for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea: a randomized trial)

5. Low-Dose Effectiveness:
Even lower doses of ethinyl estradiol have shown efficacy in treating acne. As one paper notes, "Significant reductions in total, inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions compared with placebo have been demonstrated with an OC containing the low dose of 20 μg of EE." (Treating acne with oral contraceptives: use of lower doses)

6. Potential for Worsening Acne:
It's important to note that some hormonal contraceptives may exacerbate acne in certain individuals. One study found that "Of 1319 subjects who completed LARC insertion, 28.5% (376/1319) experienced worsening acne following use of progestin-only LARC."
