# Consumption - Food Intolerances (allergies and or sensitivities)

An intolerance may stem from one or more of the following, though not exclusively:
- Seeds (allergenic proteins + protease inhibitors)
  - Legumes
    - Common offenders: #1 Peanuts and oil (avoid roasted), Soy
  - #3 Tree Nuts
  - Grains
    - Common offenders: Wheat, Barley, Rye (all containing gluten protein), corn products
  - Cacao Beans https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179948804116598804/1208260404103479326
  - Sunflower seeds and oil
- #2 Shellfish (tropomyosin protein)
- Dairy ([Whey protein](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1271395684779819039), etc)
  - Casein protein intolerances (this may also increase IGF-1, reduced with fermentation using L. casei / L. paracasei <#1258643805150777414> )

    - A1 beta-casein: may be harder to digest than A2
    - A2 beta-casein: may still cause issues for some
  - Whey protein intolerances (this may also increase fasting insulin and IGF-1)
  - Protein hormones (water-soluble)
   - IGF-1 presence (reduced with fermentation, organic/non-rBGH) https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1250722305261305947
  - Skim milk (increases intolerance by reducing concentration of fat, and increasing concentration of other water soluble components listed here)
  - Lactose sugar (reduced with fermentation)
  - Pasteurized, ultra-heat treated (nutrient loss, etc)
  - Homogenized fat
  - Steroid hormones (fat soluble)
   - Estrogens, Progesterons, Androgens, Corticosteroids
  - [Histamines](https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179952310831566868) (particularly in aged cheeses)
  - Mould presence (particularly in aged cheeses)

---

- Eggs
  - Egg whites (more common allergen than yolk, various proteins could cause it especially if undercooked)
  - Egg yolk (higher amounts of progesterone than egg whites)
  - Poorly fed chickens
  - Cooking method
- Nightshades 
  - Common Examples: Tomatoes, Potatoes, Bell Peppers
- Fructans
  - Common Examples: Wheat, Onion, Garlic
- Salicylates
- Additives: food preservative, sweeteners, etc https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179949494788431872
- Foods high in anti-nutrients

# Food intolerances and acne

Food Allergy as a Risk Factor for Acne: A study published in 2022 in "Voprosy pitaniia" found that food allergies might be a risk factor for acne. The study observed a high frequency of sensitization to food allergens in acne patients, with significant allergens including chicken egg, chicken meat, barley, oat groats, cow's milk protein, and beef. An elimination diet led to a regression of skin inflammatory manifestations in 71.9% of cases, suggesting a possible link between food allergies and acne development [Barilo & Smirnova, 2022].

Diet and Skin Conditions: A 2020 article in "Cutis" discussed the role of diet in various skin conditions, including acne vulgaris. It noted that high glycemic index foods are associated with acne vulgaris. The article also mentioned that children with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at higher risk for food allergies, and a subset may experience flares in relation to non-IgE-mediated food allergies [Greenberg, 2020].

# Celiac disease
"having a diagnosis of acne was positively associated with celiac disease (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.20–1.51)."

The odds ratio (OR) for acne associated with celiac disease (CD) found in the paper "Risk of Skin Disorders in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study" by Benjamin Lebwohl et al., was 1.39 (95% CI 1.29-1.50).

## IgG and acne 2
"Most frequent allergens were: sheep milk (TPP%: 69.1%), casein (66.7%), cow milk (65.5%), yolk (63.1%), egg white, pea, green bean (both 61.6%) and wheat (60.3%). AbRs were high (level 3) for participants exhibiting eczema, dermatitis, **acne**, abdominal gas and swelling."

"The most frequent AbRs found in Spanish adults were related to milk, egg, legumes and wheat. Wheat allergen was linked to body weight, body fat and BMI."

"The present study analyzed a sample of 205 Spanish adults with self-reported signs and symptoms attributed to FA or FI. The most frequent self-reported signs and symptoms were related to skin and subcutaneous tissue (eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, **acne**). The skin is the most frequently affected target organ in ARFS and has been reported in the past two decades to be around 40 to 60% for type I allergy (food-specific IgE AbRs) and a generalized eczematous rash or dyshidrosiform reactions of the fingers, palms, and soles for delayed-type reactions (IgG4 AbRs)"

## IgG elimination diet for acne

> Both the Actual test group and the Common-foods report group showed a noticeable decrease in GAGS Score at the 12-week mark, with the Actual test group demonstrating a more pronounced reduction. This finding suggests that eliminating diet guided by food-specific IgG antibodies may indeed alleviate acne inflammation.

Maiprasert, Mart, et al. "Elimination Diet Guided by Food-Specific IgG Antibodies Measurements in Chronic Adult Acne in Thailand: A Prospective RCT Study." International Journal of Statistics in Medical Research 13 (2024): 291-303.

## IgG elimination case report

> There was a reduction and the transition of severe acne to a mild form.

> Local therapy for acne treatment, local combined antibiotic creams and retinoids, and appropriate skin hydration and facial cleansing products were given.

while acne improved, the study design cannot isolate whether the improvement was due to the elimination diet, the conventional treatments, or a combination of both approaches.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
