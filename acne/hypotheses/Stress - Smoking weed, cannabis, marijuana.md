Cannabis use or related behaviors may influence acne. The following is an association, not causation. Note: The study doesn't specify the method of cannabis use.

- "The regular use of cannabis was associated with acne, with an odds ratio of 2.88 (95% CI: 1.55-5.37). "

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes was seen as "protective" against acne:
- "Smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day was highly associated with no acne, with an odds ratio of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.30-0.66)"
