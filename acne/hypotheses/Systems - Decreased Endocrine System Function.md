# Systems - Decreased Endocrine System Function

- Hormonal Imbalance and Acne: The endocrine system regulates the body's hormones. When it doesn't function properly, it can lead to hormonal imbalances, which are a primary cause of acne. Conditions like insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which are associated with endocrine dysfunction, have been linked to an increased occurrence of acne​​​
- Role of Androgens and Sebaceous Glands: Excess production of certain hormones, especially androgens, can lead to increased acne development. The skin, including sebaceous glands, is influenced by these hormones. Androgens promote the production of sebum, an oily substance, in these glands. Acne is considered an androgen-mediated dermatosis​
- Mechanism of Acne Formation: Acne is caused by clogged pores, which occur due to excess sebum production. This oil, produced in greater amounts due to hormonal changes, interacts with bacteria on the skin, leading to acne. Factors contributing to clogged pores include excess sebum, dead skin cells, and bacteria

Common causes:
    Hormonal Imbalances: These can be due to various factors such as stress, poor diet, or underlying health conditions, leading to disruption in hormone production.
    Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis or type 1 diabetes, where the immune system attacks endocrine glands, impairing their function.
    Genetic Disorders: Certain inherited conditions can affect endocrine glands. For example, Turner syndrome can impact ovarian function.
    Infections or Inflammation: These can damage endocrine tissues, affecting gland functionality.
    Tumors or Nodules: Both benign and malignant growths can disrupt normal endocrine function by damaging glandular tissue or producing excess hormones.

1. **Androgens (Elevated levels can stimulate sebum production, leading to acne)**
   - **Adrenal Glands**: Produce androgens like testosterone and DHEA.
   - **Ovaries/Testes**: Major sources of androgen production.
   - **Skin**: Sebaceous glands in the skin produce sebum.

2. **DHEA/DHEAS**
   - **Adrenal Glands**: Primary site of DHEA and DHEAS production.
   - **Gonads**: Convert DHEA to other sex hormones.
   - **Skin**: Utilizes DHEA for local hormone synthesis affecting skin health.

3. **DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)**
   - **Prostate**: A significant site of DHT action, affecting growth and function.
   - **Adrenal Glands**: produce precursors (like DHEA and androstenedione) that can be converted into testosterone and then into DHT in peripheral tissues.
   - **Skin**: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands are highly responsive to DHT.

4. **Androstenedione**
   - **Adrenal Glands**: Produce androstenedione.
   - **Ovaries/Testes**: Convert androstenedione to other sex hormones.
   - **Liver**: Metabolizes androstenedione.

5. **Estrogens (particularly Estradiol) and Progesterone (Imbalances can affect skin health)**
   - **Ovaries**: Primary source of estrogen and progesterone production in women.
   - **Adrenal Glands**: Produce small amounts of these hormones.
   - **Skin**: Responds to hormonal changes affecting health and appearance.

6. **Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) (Important for understanding overall hormonal balance)**
   - **Pituitary Gland**: Produces LH and FSH.
   - **Ovaries/Testes**: Target organs of LH and FSH, critical for reproductive function.
   - **Hypothalamus**: Regulates the release of these hormones through GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone).

7. **Cortisol**
   - **Adrenal Glands**: Produce cortisol in response to stress.
   - **Liver**: Metabolizes cortisol.
   - **Brain**: Hypothalamus and pituitary gland regulate cortisol production through the HPA axis (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis).

8. **Growth Hormone (GH)**
   - **Pituitary Gland**: Produces and secretes growth hormone.
   - **Liver**: Produces IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) in response to GH, mediating many of GH's effects.
   - **Bones and Muscles**: Primary targets for growth and development effects.

"The early development of comedonal acne may be one of the best predictors of later, more severe disease. The adrenal hormone DHEAS appears to play an important role in the initiation of acne. DHEAS, testosterone, and FT are associated with the perpetuation of severe comedonal acne"

## Cushing disease / cortisol
"She also reported irregular menstruation and hirsutism mainly to her back. Serum baseline tests at the time demonstrated no abnormalities, but further serum cortisol and free urinary cortisol were exceedingly high. Subsequently an MRI pituitary scan demonstrated a 3-mm microadenoma, in keeping with a diagnosis of Cushing disease. She has now been transferred to a tertiary paediatric endocrinology unit. This case highlights the importance of the dermatological manifestations of rare conditions such as this, and that the skin is often the window to many underlying medical conditions."

## Increase in cortisol from contraceptive, but still reduced acne. primarily through reduction in testosterone?
"Results showed that both treatments demonstrated effectiveness but that women treated with azelaic acid presented a better sleep quality after the treatment compared to baseline and to the group treated with the combined oral contraceptive. The combined oral contraceptive group presented an increase in cortisol and a decrease in free testosterone concentration in relation to baseline"

## High testosterone isnt really prevalent in women with acne?
"Results A total of 220 female patients of acne were enrolled. Mean age of the patients was 22.7±5.4
years. Mean duration of disease was 11.8±8.7 months, while mean BMI was 24.38±3.80 kg/m2.
High serum testosterone level was observed in 22 patients (10%)"
