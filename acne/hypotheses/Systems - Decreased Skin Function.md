# Systems - Decreased Skin Function

- Compromised Skin Barrier: The skin barrier, also known as the epidermal barrier, is essential for protecting against external irritants, pollutants, and bacteria. When this barrier is compromised, it can no longer effectively protect the skin or retain moisture. This can result in increased sensitivity, redness, dryness, and irritation, all of which are conducive to acne development​​​​​
- Increased Bacterial Growth and Inflammation: A damaged skin barrier allows bacteria and irritants to penetrate more easily, which can cause inflammation. This inflammation, in turn, can disrupt the balance of natural oils, leading to an overproduction of sebum (oil) and the formation of acne. Moreover, an impaired skin barrier can disrupt the natural skin flora, leading to an overgrowth of acne-causing bacteria​
- Follicular Changes and Sebum Production: In acne-affected skin, changes occur in the follicular epithelial barrier, which is directly involved in both comedogenesis (the formation of comedones) and stages of inflammation. These changes include larger sebaceous glands, higher sebum excretion, and altered expression of skin proteins like filaggrin. Such changes can compromise the barrier's integrity, exacerbating acne​
- Exacerbation of Existing Acne: When the skin's protective layer is impaired, it becomes more susceptible to various skin conditions, including acne. The compromised skin barrier can worsen existing acne and also trigger new breakouts, highlighting the importance of maintaining or repairing the skin barrier
