# Fasting for acne biomarkers

## Intermittent fasting for reducing IGF-1
> Interestingly, although reductions in the anabolic hormones testosterone and **IGF-1** were observed, this did not correspond to any deleterious body composition changes or compromises of muscular strength over the duration of the study.

> A significant reduction in GAGS score, IL-17, IFN-γ, and MDA levels was observed after Ramadan fasting compared to before Ramadan. Additionally, the percentage decrease in GAGS score showed a positive correlation with the percentage decrease in IFN-γ.

## Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) for skin hydration

> The results of the study revealed that the three consecutive monthly cycles of FMD resulted in a significant percentage increase in skin hydration at day 11 (p = 0.00013) and at day 71 (p = 0.02) relative to baseline.

FMD Protocol in the Study
    Duration: 5 consecutive days, repeated monthly for three cycles (days 1–5, 30–34, 60–64).
    Delivery: Participants received pre-packaged ProLon meal kits, replacing all usual meals during the 5-day periods.
    Instructions: Diaries tracked consumption, ensuring adherence to the provided foods.

Caloric Intake:
    Day 1: Approximately 1,100 calories.
    Days 2–5: Reduced to about 700–800 calories per day.
    This represents a significant reduction from typical daily intake (e.g., 2,000–2,500 calories for an average adult), inducing a fasting-like state.

Macronutrient Breakdown:
    Low in Protein and Carbohydrates: Typically, protein is limited to ~10% of calories, and carbs are kept low (often 30–40%) to minimize insulin and IGF-1 signaling.
    High in Healthy Fats: Around 50–60% of calories come from fats, primarily from plant-based sources like nuts, seeds, and olive oil, to sustain energy without breaking the fasting state.
