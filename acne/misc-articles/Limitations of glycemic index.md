# Limitations of glycemic index

- The GI calculation doesn't account for the potential "rebound" hypoglycemia, which can indeed make a food's glycemic impact appear better on paper than it might be in practice.
- Glycemic responses can vary significantly between individuals and even for the same individual on different days. Factors like stress, sleep, previous meals, and overall health status can all influence how a person responds to a particular food.
- The GI focuses solely on glucose response and doesn't consider fructose levels in the blood. This can be particularly relevant for fruits and foods containing high-fructose corn syrup.
- The GI doesn't take into account realistic portion sizes, which can lead to misleading conclusions about a food's actual impact on blood sugar in typical consumption patterns - Carrots have a high glycaemic index – if you consume 50 grams of carbohydrate in carrots, your blood sugar will rise pretty high. But you would have to eat 1.3lbs – 600 grams – of carrots to get 50 grams of carbohydrate. Highly unlikely. Glycemic load is better for this reason.

## Acne
- It has been proposed that insulin index may be of better value than glycemic index when it comes to acne: https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179956411858427954/1354948465628676219
- Some trials controlling glycemic index for acne have failed to produce good outcomes. Some trials controlling glycemic load instead of index have produced favourable outcomes: https://discord.com/channels/1169738819688468501/1179948367405645885/1208321340709277768
