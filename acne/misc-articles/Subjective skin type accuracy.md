# Subjective skin type accuracy

Study 1 (Youn et al., 2002):
1. In the subjective oily group:
   - 75% were classified as oily by Sebumeter measurements
   - 25% were classified as normal by Sebumeter measurements

2. In the subjective normal group:
   - 35.5% were classified as normal by Sebumeter measurements
   - 64.5% were classified as oily by Sebumeter measurements

3. In the subjective dry group:
   - 9.7% were classified as dry by Sebumeter measurements
   - 48.4% were classified as normal by Sebumeter measurements
   - 41.9% were classified as oily by Sebumeter measurements

Study 2 (Choi et al., 2013):
1. Overall agreement between subjective and objective skin type:
   - Raw agreement: 35%
   - Kappa coefficient: 0.045 (indicating weak agreement)

2. Agreement by skin type:
   - Dry skin: 23.4% agreement
   - Normal skin: 30.0% agreement
   - Oily skin: 19.9% agreement
   - Combination skin: 54.1% agreement

3. 95% Confidence Intervals of Casual Sebum Levels (CSL) for subjective skin types (whole face):
   - Dry: 97.3–147.6 μg/cm²
   - Normal: 118.7–180.9 μg/cm²
   - Combination: 159.8–190.6 μg/cm²
   - Oily: 172.5–201.1 μg/cm²
