# Seasonal variation in acne

## Mixed self reported aggravations
> Results. About one‐third of the patients reported an aggravation of their acne in winter, but also approximately one‐third of the patients complained about an aggravation of their acne in summer. Another third did not notice any change

## Self reported aggravations in summer - due to sweating and increased humidity
> A total of 229 patients (50.67%) complained of a seasonal variation; a significant proportion (56.33%) noticed an aggravation in summer, while 16.16% improved in summer and only 11.35% worsened in winter. Apparently winters did not affect the severity of acne in a majority of patients (64.20%). Significantly, a majority (80.62%) of patients noticed a summer aggravation due to sweating and increased humidity.

## Clinic visit frequencies - lower in summer
> Patients suffering from acne vulgaris made up 19.6% of the new cases seen at the clinic. The male to female ratio was 1 : 1.8. The mean age of onset was 16.3 ± 2.1 years for males and 14.8 ± 3.9 years for females (P = 0.003). The largest numbers of patients were seen during the cold months of the year (November to February)

## Patient beliefs - heat and humidity worsens acne
> Dirty skin and excessive heat and humidity were thought to be responsible for making acne worse by 11.7% and 5% of respondents, respectively

## Standardized physician assessments (PGA scores) across seasons - improvements in summer
> Eighteen percent of patients were seen in summer, 25% in fall, 28% in winter, and 29% in spring. Acne cleared in the fall: 17.5% of patients were graded effectively clear compared to 13.5% in winter (Fig 2). When effectively clear patients were compared over all 4 seasons, a chi-square test was significant (P < .01). Conversely, acne worsened in the winter (P < .01; Fig 2). Analysis of 6101 acne patients seen multiple times maintained the significant trend of summer clearing (P < .01) and winter worsening (P < .05).

Subjects with acne had a >7.2-fold higher ( P < .05) unsaturated FFA fraction and a 14.8-fold higher ( P < .05) level of sapienic acid than the age-matched nonacne group. More unexpectedly changes were observed in the composition and levels of epidermal lipids isolated from acne individuals. The proportion of ceramides to total lipids was 28% in the acne group and 56% in the nonacne group. **Seasonal increases in ceramides appeared to be associated with improved acne although the changes were observed in both groups**. Barrier function was impaired in the acne group compared with the non-acne group (increased TEWL)

## Epidermal ceramides across seasons - partly resolves in summer
> Acne‐affected skin demonstrated overall lower levels of ceramides, with notable reductions in CER[NH] and CER[AH] ceramides, as well as the acylceramides CER[EOS] and CER[EOH]; these differences were more apparent in the winter months. Lower ceramide levels reflected an increase in TEWL in acne, compared with healthy skin, **which partly resolves in the summer**

## Patients were specifically questioned if their acne aggravated, improved, or did not change with the seasons
> Results Out of 171 patients, 82 (47.95%) patients reported seasonal variation in their acne. Among them, 69 patients (40.4%) reported aggravation in summer. Eleven (6.42%) and 2 (1.16%) patients reported aggravation in winter and rainy season, respectively. The aggravation in summer as compared to rainy and winter season was statistically significant. The mean temperature and mean humidity significantly varied with seasonal aggravation of acne

# Facial adult female acne in China: An analysis based on artificial intelligence over one million
- "The ranking of acne severity from worst to least severe throughout four seasons was fall, winter, summer, and spring (all p < 0.0001)"
- "As for altitude and radiation, due to their intrinsic correlation, we found that both high altitude and high total solar radiation were positively correlated with acne severity."
