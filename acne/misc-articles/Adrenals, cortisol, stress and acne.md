# Adrenals, cortisol, stress and acne

## Addisons / adrenal insufficiency

1. Some patients with Addison's disease experienced acne as a side effect of oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement therapy.

## Adrenal Hyperplasia / 21-hydroxylase deficiency
- Premature acne can be caused by premature adrenarche secondary to non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH), which is due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This highlights a link between early acne onset and adrenal dysfunction.

- Acne unresponsive to isotretinoin might be a sign of a congenital disorder, specifically a non-classical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which involves anomalies in androgen metabolism.
*Isotretinoin-unresponsive acne as a sign of a congenital disorder: a case of 21-hydroxylase deficiency*

- Mild congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) could be a major contributor to the development of acne, even in patients who do not exhibit other clinical manifestations of CAH.
*Acne and 'mild' adrenal hyperplasia. A short critical review*

- Disorders of androgen metabolism, including conditions like late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, may influence acne in men.
*Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and acne in male patients*

- Isotretinoin treatment leads to a significant decrease in morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, indicating a mild suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis. This suppression may be beneficial for addressing the pathogenesis of acne.
*Isotretinoin Influences Pituitary Hormone Levels in Acne Patients*

- Mild adrenal hyperplasia might be associated with an overproduction of certain hormones that can lead to acne.

## Cushing's syndrome
- Cushing disease is associated with high levels of cortisol, produced by the adrenal glands or a pituitary adenoma. This case suggests that adrenal dysfunction (as part of Cushing disease) can manifest in dermatological symptoms such as acne.
*P15 A rare case of paediatric Cushing disease presenting as acne*

- Among the most common diagnostic manifestations of Cushing's syndrome (CS) are those involving the skin; they include violaceous striae, facial acne, hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans (AN), fungal infections, hyperpigmentation (Hp) and easy bruisability.
