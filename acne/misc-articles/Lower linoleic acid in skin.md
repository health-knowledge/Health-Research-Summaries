# Lower linoleic acid in skin

Fatty Acids of Acylceramides From Comedones and From the Skin Surface of Acne Patients and Control Subjects
Response: YES. 

The relationship is that in both comedonal acylceramides and acylceramides from the skin surface of acne patients, there is a higher presence of certain fatty acids and a significantly lower presence of linoleate compared to control subjects without acne. This indicates that fatty acids from sebum replace linoleate in acylceramides, which affects acne patients more than normal subjects.
