## Topical 5% nicotinamide gel versus 2% clindamycin gel
> Five percent nicotinamide gel is as effective as 2% clindamycin gel for treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. No side effect was observed during the treatment.

## Oral nicotinamide products
> Two studies involving oral nicotinamide therapy for acne vulgaris matched our search criteria (Table 3). Niren and Torok used a com- bination product containing nicotinamide, zinc, copper, and folic acid and demonstrated a significant improvement in acne vulgaris compared with acne prior to treatment (Niren & Torok, 2006). There was no difference in acne lesions when an oral antibiotic (name not stated in primary article) was combined with the nicotin- amide combination product. Shalita et al. used a combination prod- uct containing nicotinamide, azelaic acid, zinc, pyridoxine, copper, and folic acid and showed a significant improvement in acne vulga- ris compared with acne prior to treatment (Shalita et al., 2012). Participants in this study were permitted to continue their regular acne regimens during the study; therefore, it is unclear if the treat- ment was responsible for the improvement in acne vulgaris. In both studies, the individual components of each combination product were not tested separately; therefore, it is unclear if nicotinamide itself contributed to the improvement in acne vulgaris. There were no studies that tested the effect of oral nicotinamide on acne vul- garis as a single-agent.

## Facial pores
> Facial pore counts were significantly decreased by 20.8% (P = 0.0002) and 15.9% (P = 0.0028) in the kinetin plus niacinamide group at weeks 8 and 12, respectively. A significant decrease was also apparent in the niacinamide alone group at week 8 only (14.7%, P = 0.0034).
