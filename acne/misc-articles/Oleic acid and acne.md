# Oleic acid and acne

Based on the provided research, oleic acid appears to have predominantly negative effects on acne when applied topically or present in excess on the skin. However, its role when taken orally is less clear. Here's a summary of the findings:

## Negative effects of topical/skin oleic acid:

### 1. Comedogenesis: Oleic acid can induce comedone formation when applied topically. 

"Application of squalene or oleic acid peroxides onto rabbit skin significantly increased comedone formation." ("Enhanced comedo formation in rabbit ear skin by squalene and oleic acid peroxides")

### 2. Barrier disruption: Oleic acid can disrupt the skin barrier and lead to abnormal keratinization.

"We suggest that the permeability barrier disruption in oleic‐acid‐applied follicular epithelium can be induced by the changes of SC intercellular membrane structures and lacunar dilatation, and the calcium gradient is lost, so follicular epithelial proliferation and hyperkeratosis can be induced and then comedo formation occurs." ("The changes of stratum corneum interstices and calcium distribution of follicular epithelium of experimentally induced comedones (EIC) by oleic acid")

### 3. Inflammation: Oleic acid can induce inflammatory responses in skin cells.

"Oleic acid (C18:1, cis‐9) dose‐ and time‐dependently regulated the mRNA expression of IL‐36γ and IL‐37 in cultured keratinocytes" ("Oleic acid‐induced interleukin‐36γ: A possible link between facial skin redness and sebum")

### 4. Abnormal differentiation: Oleic acid can cause abnormal differentiation of epidermis.
"Oleic acid ... induced scaly skin, abnormal keratinization, and epidermal hyperplasia." ("Unsaturated Fatty Acids Induce Calcium Influx into Keratinocytes and Cause Abnormal Differentiation of Epidermis")

### 5. Elevated levels in acne: Acne patients tend to have higher levels of oleic acid in their sebum.
"The free fatty acids (FFAs)—specifically, oleic acid (p = 0.002) and stearic acid (p = 0.013)—were elevated ... in the sebum of acne patients compared to controls." ("Comparative analysis of the skin surface lipids between acne patients and controls using UFLC method")

## Potential benefits or unclear effects of oral oleic acid:

### 1. Unclear effect: One study suggests that oral supplementation of oleic acid might influence sebum composition, but the effect is not clearly stated as positive or negative.
"The daily administration of lymecycline and/or specific fatty acids may slightly influence some fatty acids levels present in the sebum of patients with inflammatory acne vulgaris." ("Evaluation of the Quantitative and Qualitative Alterations in the Fatty Acid Contents of the Sebum of Patients with Inflammatory Acne during Treatment with Systemic Lymecycline and/or Oral Fatty Acid Supplementation")


It's important to note that these studies primarily focused on pure oleic acid or its derivatives, not olive oil specifically. While olive oil is high in oleic acid, it also contains other compounds that might mitigate some of these effects.

In conclusion, topical oleic acid or excess oleic acid in the skin appears to be detrimental for acne. The effects of oral oleic acid supplementation on acne are less clear and require further research. It's important to note that while oleic acid may have negative effects on acne when in excess, it is a natural component of human sebum and likely plays some physiological roles in normal amounts.
