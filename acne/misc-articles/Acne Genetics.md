# Acne Genetics

Acne is a polygenic trait, meaning it has many, but small genetics factors. I think environment is more important in most cases, here's why:

- Polygenic traits exhibit greater susceptibility to environmental influences, as evidenced by various studies exploring gene-environment interactions. Research indicates that environmental perturbations can significantly modulate genetic risk factors for complex traits. For instance, a study identified thousands of environmentally responsive genes linked to polygenic traits, suggesting that environmental stimuli can enhance or diminish genetic predispositions. [1]
- Acne affects nearly 90% of people in Western societies during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. [2]
- Acne rates appear to be lower in rural societies. [3]

Although I believe acne is influenced more by environment in most cases, there is the possibility that you have rare SNPs associated with severe acne. If you're concerned that your acne is highly genetic, the only way to know this is to get your DNA sequenced and actually check the single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with acne.
