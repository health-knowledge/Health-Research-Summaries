The following are all just correlations, not necessarily causations.

## Salty snacks associated
> In the studied group of Polish female adolescents, fast foods, **salty snacks**, and chocolate confectionary were indicated as potential acne-promoting factors, while dairy beverages other than milk were indicated as a potential acne-protective factor.

## Salty snacks associated
> In the studied population, the most prominent influencing factors were **salty snacks** and non-chocolate confectionary, with both of them having a proacnegenic effect.

## Higher salt intake associated
> Patients with acne consumed significantly higher daily amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) (median 3367.54 mg) compared to the controls (median 2271.8 mg) (P < 0.001). A negative correlation between the amount of NaCl in the diet of patients with acne and the age of onset of acne lesions was detected (r = -0.216, P = 0.031). However, neither salty nor spicy food correlated with duration or severity of the disease.
