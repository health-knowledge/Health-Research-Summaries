# Blood pressure and acne

Mean (SD) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of cases were 120.2 (10.3) mm Hg and 79.1 (7.0) mm Hg, respectively, and were statistically significantly higher than those of controls (ie, 116.9 [9.1] mm Hg and 76.2 [5.9] mm Hg, respectively) (P = .01 and .002, t test, respectively; Table 1).

For acne:
- "Out of 10 patients with acne, 50% responded to treatment in the study group vs. 30% in the control group at the end of 6 months treatment (p=.87)."
For blood pressure:
- "As compared to baseline, blood pressure (BP) showed a falling trend during treatment in the study group; systolic BP reduced from 120.3±12.5 (mean±S.D.) to 118.4±7.5 (1.9 mmHg or 1.6% fall) and diastolic BP from 76.1±5.5 to 75.7±5.3 (0.4 mmHg or 0.5% fall) at end of 6 months of treatment (pN.05)."
Note: The study does not address any potential relationship between acne outcomes and blood pressure changes. These outcomes were reported separately, and no analysis or discussion was presented regarding a possible correlation between improvements in acne and changes in blood pressure. The researchers did not appear to examine whether patients who experienced improvements in acne also tended to show decreases in blood pressure, or vice versa.

> The results thus obtained are as follows, patients had higher BMI (p = 0.003), WC (p = 0.002), WHR (p = 0.02), **SBP (p = 0.0001), DBP (p = 0.001)**, basal (p = 0.01) and 120 min. oGTT serum insulin concentrations (p = 0.002), basal glucose concentrations (p = 0.03), HOMA-IR (p = 0.016), and lower HDL-cholesterol than controls (p = 0.001). Among the subgroup of subjects with BMI <24.9, HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.05) and 120 min. oGTT serum insulin concentrations (p = 0.009) resulted to be independent predictors of acne at multivariate analysis.
