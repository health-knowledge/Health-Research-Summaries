# Accutane (Isotretinoin) for acne - efficacy and relapse, recurrence

Efficacy:
- Isotretinoin is highly effective for treating acne, with most studies reporting 80-100% clearance rates.
- The study by Blasiak et al. found that "At 12 months' follow-up, 97.4% of the patients reported that their acne was improved."
- Borghi et al. reported "complete recovery" in their patients treated with isotretinoin.
- Ghalamkarpour & Nasiri found "Complete cure was achieved in 65% of patients."

Relapse rates across all studies varied from about 4% (Yap) to 58% (Kassem et al. for high GAGS score patients), with most studies reporting rates between 30-45%.:
- Blasiak et al.: 32.7% overall relapse rate at 12 months. Lower dose group had 47.4% relapse vs 26.9% in high dose group.
- Kassem et al.: "The average relapse rate was 58.0% for those with initial GAGS scores of 25-30 compared with 5.5% for those with scores of 19-24."
- Azoulay et al.: 41% experienced acne relapse.
- Cakir et al.: 8 patients relapsed during first year, 16 during second year (out of 96 total).
- Ibrahim et al.: "approximately 36% of patients experienced acne relapse" at 2-year follow-up.
- Yap: 
  - Only 4% had mild relapse 1 year post-treatment. 
  - For those who relapsed, mean time to relapse was 32.3 weeks. 
  - Continued use of topical clindamycin may have helped prevent relapses. 
  - Very long treatment duration may have contributed to better outcomes
  - Only counting cases requiring isotretinoin retreatment would give even lower rates
  - The definition of relapse was clear but relatively strict (after "total clearance")
- Morales-Cardona et al.: "The relapse rate was 15 events per 100 person-years of follow-up."
- Borghi et al.: 9.35% relapse rate at 2-year follow-up.
  - Relapse defined as "emergence of acne â‰¥0.5 grade severity and/or requiring systemic treatment"
  - Continued isotretinoin for 1 month AFTER complete clearance
  - Structured maintenance with adapalene for 1 year
- Alshammari et al.: 45.12% relapse rate.
- Demirci Saadet found a "relapse rate was found as 37.3%" with "The median time to relapse was 10 months."

Factors linked to higher relapse rates:
- Lower cumulative dose of isotretinoin
- Younger age 
- Male sex
- Higher initial acne severity
- Presence of macrocomedones
- Early discontinuation of treatment
- Lack of maintenance therapy e.g. adapelene

In conclusion, while isotretinoin is highly effective for acne, relapse remains a significant issue affecting roughly 20-40% of patients on average. Using higher cumulative doses and adding maintenance therapy may help reduce relapse rates.
