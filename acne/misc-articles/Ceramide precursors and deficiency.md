# Ceramide precursors and deficiency

These are the key building blocks that are directly incorporated or used in the ceramide synthesis pathway:

1. Amino Acids:
   - Serine: The primary amino acid used in the first step of sphingoid base synthesis

2. Fatty Acids:
   - Palmitic acid (C16:0): A key starting point for sphingoid base synthesis
   - Stearic acid (C18:0)
   - Lignoceric acid (C24:0)
   - Nervonic acid (C24:1)
   - Cerotic acid (C26:0)

3. Sphingoid Bases:
   - Sphingosine
   - Dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine)
   - Phytosphingosine

4. Cofactors and Enzymes:
   - Coenzyme A (CoA): Essential for fatty acid activation
   - NADPH: Used in reduction steps of sphingoid base synthesis
   - Serine palmitoyltransferase: The enzyme catalyzing the first step of sphingolipid synthesis

5. Vitamins and Minerals (as enzyme cofactors):
   - Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Precursor to NADPH
   - Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid): Precursor to Coenzyme A
   - Zinc: Cofactor for various enzymes in lipid metabolism

6. Cholesterol:
   - While not directly incorporated into ceramides, cholesterol is essential for proper ceramide function in the skin barrier

These precursors are preferentially used because they directly align with the structure and synthesis pathway of ceramides. The body has specific enzymes and pathways optimized for using these particular molecules in ceramide production.

> Ceramide deficiency is believed to be associated with a decreased water-holding capacity, follicular hyperkeratosis, and comedone formation [36]. Our findings shed more light on this by differentiating the correlations between non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions and suggesting that the correlation is with comedone formation (non-inflammatory lesions) rather than inflammation (inflammatory lesions).

Title: Seasonal changes in epidermal ceramides are linked to impaired barrier function in acne patients
Response: YES

The article indicates that lower ceramide levels, particularly CER[NH] and CER[AH] ceramides, as well as acylceramides like CER[EOS] and CER[EOH], are associated with acne. This deficiency in ceramides contributes to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in acne-affected skin compared to healthy skin, with the differences being more pronounced in the winter months.

Title: Insights into acne and the skin barrier: Optimizing treatment regimens with ceramide‐containing skincare
Response: YES.

The article mentions that in acne-affected skin, "stratum corneum lipids are reduced." This suggests a reduction in ceramides, which are a crucial component of stratum corneum lipids. Therefore, ceramide deficiency is implicated in the compromised skin barrier associated with acne.

Title: Seasonal changes in stratum corneum ceramides linked to impaired barrier function in acne patients
Response: YES. 

The relationship mentioned in the study title suggests that seasonal changes in stratum corneum ceramides are linked to impaired barrier function in acne patients.

Title: Seasonal changes in epidermal ceramides are linked to impaired barrier function in acne patients
Response: YES.

*Relationship:* The article indicates that acne-affected skin demonstrates overall lower levels of ceramides compared to healthy skin. This deficiency is linked to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in acne patients, suggesting impaired skin barrier function. The reduction in ceramide levels, specifically CER[NH], CER[AH], CER[EOS], and CER[EOH], is more prominent in the winter months.

## Increased ceramides worsened
Title: Skin surface lipidomics revealed the correlation between lipidomic profile and grade in adolescent acne
Response: YES.

The article indicates that the relative average content of ceramides (Cers) significantly increased from mild to moderate adolescent acne. Therefore, ceramides are associated with the severity of acne, showing an increase as the acne progresses from mild to moderate.

Title: Serum Sphingolipidomic Analysis in Acne Vulgaris Patients
Response: YES. 

The relationship indicated in the article is that patients with acne vulgaris (AV) have significantly decreased serum levels of very-long-chain C24 ceramide (CER) compared to controls. This suggests a ceramide deficiency in AV patients.

Title: Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CJLP55 on Clinical Improvement, Skin Condition and Urine Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles in Patients with Acne Vulgaris: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study
Response: YES.

The article mentions an increase in ceramide 2, which is the major ceramide species that maintains the epidermal lipid barrier for hydration. CJLP55 supplement increased ceramide 2, contributing to improved hydration.

Title: Lipidomics reveals skin surface lipid abnormity in acne in young men
Response: YES

The reduction in the chain length of ceramides contributes to an altered lipid organization and decreased skin barrier function in acne.

Title: Impaired water barrier function in acne vulgaris
Response: YES. 

The article suggests that an impaired water barrier function caused by decreased amounts of ceramides may be responsible for comedo formation in acne patients.

Title: Influence of oral isotretinoin treatment on the composition of comedonal lipids. Implications for comedogenesis in acne vulgaris
Response: YES.

The relationship described in the article is that oral isotretinoin treatment led to an increase in total ceramides by 19% in the comedonal lipids. This suggests that isotretinoin-induced changes towards a ceramide composition more similar to normal epidermal lipids may contribute to its comedolytic effect in treating acne vulgaris.
