# Purging (Treatment induced acne flare)

The phenomena often attributed to "purging" could indeed be cases of acne cosmetica, as there's limited scientific evidence to conclusively distinguish between these concepts, highlighting the need for more rigorous research in this area of skincare.

> It is unlikely that acne worsens or "flares" due to the initiation of topical retinoids. Some acne patients may have worsening of acne during the first week or two as part of the natural disease process.

> Almost twice as many study participants with mild acne at baseline demonstrated a 10 percent or greater increase in number of inflammatory lesions as compared to subjects in the vehicle arm (15.4% vs 8.7%)

- Initial worsening: "In about 20% of patients, crops of new pustules and papules suddenly appeared during the initial weeks of therapy."
- Inflammatory "explosion": The authors describe that under the influence of vitamin A acid, previously inert comedones suddenly "blew-up", leading to inflammatory lesions. They state: "This acceleration of the natural acne process often resulted in a worsening of the clinical picture during the first six weeks of therapy."
- Misinterpretation risk: "If final drug evaluations had been made at this time, we could have come to quite the opposite conclusions regarding the value of vitamin A acid."
- Irritation: The study describes vitamin A acid as "a fairly potent irritant" causing redness and scaling within 48 hours. This irritation could be mistaken for or contribute to inflammatory acne.
- Authors mention that some patients, particularly those with "persistent nodular and cystic forms may even be made worse."

For topical retinoids, there's a study that mentions that an exacerbation of acne, called a "retinoid flare", may appear at the beginning of treatment:
"The exacerbation of acne, the so-called 'retinoid flare' may appear at the beginning of treatment, usually in the first weeks of therapy and persist for several weeks."

The paper also notes that for some treatments, side effects like skin irritation tend to be worst in the first few weeks and then improve:
"The intensity of skin irritation related to topical treatment with adapalene increases in intensity to a maximum at week 2 of treatment and regularly decreases to week 12."

For azelaic acid, it states:
"According to the reports, the frequency and duration of local reactions are highest in the first 4–8 weeks of treatment. Those unpleasant symptoms usually decrease after a continued use."

## Tretinoin (or placebo) induced acne flares in **non-acne patients**
### (evidence that "purging" could just be acne cosmetica)
- "Forty Caucasian patients, ages 30 to 50, with mild or moderate photoaging of the face, forearms, and hands, were entered in the 48-week study."
- "All patients received tretinoin emollient cream (TEC) 0.01%... daily to opposite forearms and hands for 48 weeks, and half of the patients were randomly assigned to receive TEC 0.01% to the face for 48 weeks. Patients who received the placebo vehicle to the face for the first 24 weeks crossed over to open-label TEC 0.01% to the face for the remaining 24 weeks."
- "The most common adverse experiences were dryness, peeling, and **acne**." 
- "Although not statistically significant, some evidence suggested that the active-treatment group was more likely to experience dryness (64.7% vs 35.3%, P = .09), and the placebo group was more likely to experience acne (52.9% vs 29.4%, P = .19)."
