# LA, GLA, ALA, CLA fatty acids and acne

Based on the provided research summaries, several fatty acids appear to play significant roles in acne treatment and prevention. Here's a summary of the key findings:

1. Linoleic Acid:
Linoleic acid shows promise in treating acne through multiple mechanisms. It has been found to "reduce the size of sebaceous glands, thereby decreasing sebum production" and "a deficiency in linoleic acid has been linked with the development of acne lesions" [3]. Topical application of linoleic acid has shown effectiveness in "normalization of follicular hyperkeratinization" [8] and can act as a "comedolytic agent in acne-prone patients" [22]. One study found that "topically applied linoleic acid on the size of follicular casts and microcomedones, an almost 25% reduction in their overall size being achieved over a 1-month treatment period" [22].

2. Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA):
GLA has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties beneficial for acne treatment. A study showed that "After 10 weeks of omega-3 fatty acid or γ-linoleic acid supplementation, inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions decreased significantly" [5].

3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids:
Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly when combined with other polyunsaturated fatty acids, show potential in managing acne. Research indicates that "combined ω-6, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and ω-3 long-chain PUFAs supplementation exhibits the highest potential in diminishing inflammatory processes, which could be beneficial for the management of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne" [12].

4. Docosapentaenoic Acid:
This fatty acid has shown positive effects on acne, with one study noting that "Docosapentaenoic acid and γ‐linolenic acid have demonstrated improved acne lesions" [1].

5. Alpha-Linolenic Acid:
Alpha-linolenic acid has been identified as an anti-inflammatory agent useful in acne treatment. One study mentioned "anti-inflammatory agents such as nicotinamide, alpha‐linolenic acid and zinc salts" as effective in treating acne [2].

6. Sapienic Acid:
Research has shown that certain treatments can regulate sebum composition in acne patients by "increasing the level of sapienic and linolenic acid and reducing the level of oleic acid" [11].

It's important to note that while many of these fatty acids show promise, their effectiveness can vary. For instance, one study found that "using 3 gr oral conjugated linoleic acid daily for 1 month has no effect on remission of acne" [21]. 

The mechanisms by which these fatty acids work include reducing inflammation, regulating sebum production, and influencing bacterial activity. For example, "Linoleic and palmitoleic acids have bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes)" [6].
