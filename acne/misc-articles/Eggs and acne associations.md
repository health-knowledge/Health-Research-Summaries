# Eggs and acne associations

This is the only study we've found that shows an association between egg consumption and acne, and since the available evidence points to a negative association, we could infer that eggs may not be beneficial for individuals with acne on average. However, this can vary from person to person, with some studies showing no link at all. 

It’s important to remember the following is just an association, and overall, the data suggests a neutral to negative effect.

> The following variables were also associated with acne: consumption of chocolate ≥3 days per week (OR =2.19 [95%CI, 1.36–3.53]), potato chips (OR =3.57 [95% CI, 2.20–5.80]), and **egg (OR =1.95 [95% CI, 1.20–3.17])**

> Consumption of egg was associated with acne in our study; we were unable to find studies on this. it is thought that this association could be due to high levels of leucine (8.5%) in egg.23 Leucine is believed to control the synthesis of lipids and proteins, which increase the activity of sebaceous glands and plugging of their ducts, respectively.24
