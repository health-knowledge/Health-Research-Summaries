This study, published in "Carcinogenesis" in 2011, investigated the impact of high-fat diets rich in either omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids on UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 mice. The authors, led by You-Rong Lou and others from various departments at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, examined how these diets affected the development and progression of skin tumors.

Key points from the study:
 - Experiment Setup: SKH-1 mice were exposed to UVB radiation and fed either a high-fat fish oil (HFFO) diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids or a high-fat mixed-lipids (HFMLs) diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids.
 - Results on Tumor Development: Compared to the HFML diet, the HFFO diet:
   1. Increased the time it took for UVB-induced skin tumors to develop.
   2. Reduced the formation of various types of skin tumors (papilloma, keratoacanthoma, and carcinoma) by 64%, 52%, and 46%, respectively.
   3. Decreased the size of these tumors significantly (by 98%, 80%, and 83%, respectively).
 - Mechanistic Insights: The study found that the HFFO diet led to a significant reduction in several proinflammatory cytokines (such as TIMP-1, LIX, and sTNF R1) and stimulated UVB-induced apoptosis in the epidermis. This suggests that omega-3 fatty acids in the HFFO diet might offer protective effects against UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis, possibly through an inhibition of the UVB-induced inflammatory response.
 - Conclusion: The research concluded that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids (HFFO) has beneficial effects against UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in mice, likely associated with reduced inflammation.

The study "Oral caffeine during voluntary exercise markedly inhibits skin carcinogenesis and decreases inflammatory cytokines in UVB-treated mice" by Lou et al. investigates the combined effects of caffeine intake and voluntary exercise on skin cancer prevention and inflammation in mice treated with ultraviolet B (UVB) light. The researchers used SKH-1 hairless mice, which were divided into groups receiving different treatments: water, caffeine (0.1 mg/ml), running wheel exercise (RW), or a combination of caffeine and RW.

Key findings include:
 - Cancer Prevention: Caffeine, RW, or their combination significantly reduced the number of skin tumors per mouse (27%, 35%, and 62% respectively) and tumor volume (61%, 70%, and 85% respectively) over 14 weeks.
 - Increased Exercise Activity: The combination of caffeine and RW increased RW activity by 22% compared to RW alone, suggesting that caffeine enhances exercise performance.
 - Reduction in Fat and Inflammatory Cytokines: Caffeine plus RW for 2 weeks prior to UVB irradiation decreased the weight of the parametrial fat pads and stimulated the formation of UVB-induced apoptosis more than caffeine or RW alone. The combination treatment also lowered the levels of inflammatory cytokines like LIX, sTNFR1, and MIP-1γ, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet.
 - Mechanisms: The study suggests that the inhibition of skin carcinogenesis by the combination treatment is due to decreased tissue fat, increased UVB-induced apoptosis, and lowered levels of cytokines associated with inflammation.
 - No Significant Impact on Body Weight: Despite the changes in fat and exercise activity, the various treatments did not significantly affect the body weight of the mice.

 - The skin is exposed to harmful UVR, which can lead to various skin issues, including cancer. A reduction in the ozone layer has increased UVR exposure, making protection against it crucial.
 - Plants, exposed to constant sunlight, produce secondary metabolites like phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and alkaloids that have UVR protection activities. These compounds can potentially be used to reduce photoaging, prevent skin cancers, and mitigate other UVR-related illnesses.
 - Phenolic Compounds: These include flavonoids and high molecular weight polyphenols. They have antioxidant properties, can absorb UVR, and protect against oxidative damage. Some notable examples include caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which offer photoprotection and anti-aging effects.
 - Carotenoids: These are effective in absorbing UVR and have antioxidant capabilities. Lycopene, a well-studied carotenoid, protects against UVB photodamage and can reduce skin erythema. Dietary intake of lycopene and other carotenoids like β-carotene can provide sun protection.
 - Alkaloids: Compounds like caffeine and theobromine have shown photoprotective properties. Caffeine, in particular, can reduce skin carcinogenesis and enhance the efficacy of sunscreen formulations.
 - Oral Photoprotectors: While topical sunscreens are common, consuming certain plant-derived compounds can boost the skin's internal defense mechanisms against UVR.
 - Including foods rich in phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and alkaloids can be beneficial. This may involve consuming green tea (rich in EGCG), tomatoes (rich in lycopene), and possibly caffeine-containing beverages like coffee and tea for their potential protective effects against UVR.
 - Besides sun protection, these compounds have anti-inflammatory, antiaging, and antioxidant benefits, contributing to overall skin health.

 - Green Tea: Rich in phenolic compounds, especially epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), green tea is excellent for its antioxidant properties and potential UV protection. It also contains other flavonoids and catechins beneficial for skin health.
 - Tomatoes: A prime source of lycopene, a potent carotenoid, tomatoes are effective in protecting the skin against UV damage. Consuming cooked or processed tomatoes (like tomato paste or sauce) can enhance the bioavailability of lycopene.
 - Dark Chocolate: High in flavonoids, particularly catechins and procyanidins, dark chocolate (with a high cocoa content) provides antioxidants that can support skin health. It also contains a small amount of caffeine.
 - Berries (Blueberries, Strawberries, Raspberries): Berries are rich in a variety of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids like quercetin and anthocyanins. These compounds offer antioxidant protection and may aid in skin health and UV protection.
 - Carrots or Sweet Potatoes: Both are excellent sources of beta-carotene, a type of carotenoid that is beneficial for skin health and protection against sun damage. They also provide a range of other vitamins and nutrients beneficial for overall health.

Newly diagnosed basal cell carcinoma patients have significantly higher n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower n-3 PUFAs in their red blood cell membranes, suggesting lipids play a role in BCC development.

In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled study, 386 patients at high risk of skin cancer took either nicotinamide 500mg twice daily or a placebo for 12 months. The results were striking: the rate of new non-melanoma skin cancer was 23% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group.

TODO: USE SPF15 during high UV index, doesnt completely block Vitamin D production?
