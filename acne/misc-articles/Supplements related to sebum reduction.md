# Supplements related to sebum reduction

## Study 1 (pomegranate extract)
There was a decreasing trend in forehead sebum excretion rate in the pomegranate extract group after 4 weeks (-21.9%) compared to an increase in the placebo group (+17.2%), though this was not statistically significant (p=0.14).
No significant differences were seen in cheek sebum production.
The study did not directly examine acne, but the authors suggest the sebum reduction could potentially benefit acne-prone skin, as excess sebum production is associated with acne development.

## Study 2 (Rehmannia glutinosa leaf extract)
No statistically significant effects on sebum production were reported.
The study focused on acne severity rather than sebum production specifically. The acne severity scores improved more in the treatment group compared to placebo after 4 and 8 weeks.

## Study 3 (Terminalia chebula fruit extract)
In subjects with high baseline sebum (>80 μg/cm2), the treatment group had a significant decrease in forehead sebum compared to placebo at 4 weeks (-17% vs +20%, p=0.074) and 8 weeks (-33% vs +29%, p<0.01).
The authors note this 33% reduction is similar to effects seen with oral spironolactone, a medication used to treat acne.
They suggest this warrants further study in populations with higher sebum production like those with acne or seborrheic dermatitis.

## Topical Extract from Asparagus racemosus Willd. Root
> It can be concluded that A. racemosus root extract with a high content of polyphenol compounds, great antioxidant effects, promising downregulation of SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, and predominant facial sebum reduction and pore-minimizing efficacy could be a candidate for an anti-sebum and pore-minimizing active ingredient to serve in functional cosmetic applications.
