# Oral, dental health and acne

The article states that P. acnes is "responsible for inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and blood vessels, consequently leading to various diseases in the human body."

> This case report describes a middle-aged man with acne that was recalcitrant to numerous medications, including three courses of isotretinoin. His condition cleared after an infected tooth was removed and recurred when another tooth became carious.

1. The study focused on two teenage patients who had both gingival hypertrophy (gum inflammation/swelling) and acne vulgaris simultaneously.
2. The patients were treated with a combination of professional oral hygiene procedures and a probiotic containing Lactobacillus reuteri.
3. After 4 weeks of treatment, the authors observed improvements in both the gingival hypertrophy and acne symptoms in both patients.
4. The authors suggest there may be a correlation in the etiopathogenesis (underlying cause) of these two conditions, stating: "These cases highlight a possible correlation in the etiopathogenesis of these two conditions."
5. They propose that the probiotic treatment may have benefited the "microbiota eubiosis status" (balance of microorganisms) in both the oral cavity and on the skin, leading to reduced inflammation in both areas.
6. The paper discusses how certain probiotic strains, including L. reuteri, have shown positive effects on both oral health and skin conditions in other studies.

> Another microbe uncovered in our analysis was the association of Actinomyces naeslundii, which correlated to facial non-inflammatory lesions, and this is typically a result of periodontal disease. Our results are in agreement with other studies that have correlated periodontal disease and with dermatological diseases such as psoriasis and pemphigus
