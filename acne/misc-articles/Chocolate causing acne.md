# Chocolate consumption may exarcerbate acne
Background: Fulton's 1969 study (study funded by "Chocolate Manufacturers Association of the USA" showing that chocolate doesn't cause acne)

## Comment on the commentary: Diet and acne. 
- "Fulton et al “proved” that chocolate had no influence on acne by comparing a chocolate bar to a pseudochocolate bar composed of 28% hydrogenated vegetable oil, a food known to increase inflammatory markers.4 The sugar content of the bars was 44.3% and 53%, respectively; both were likely to induce a rapid and high insulin response and the subsequent acneigenic hormone effects." https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(08)00605-1/fulltext
