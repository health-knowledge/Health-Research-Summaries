## Whey protein doesn't affect acne?
No significant difference in acne was observed in whey protein supplementation:

## Lactoferrin supplement (a whey protein) beneficial for acne?

## On the contrary to above:
This case-control study provides evidence of a positive association between whey protein consumption and acne risk.

## Whey increases IGF-1
Contrary to the above, a 2-year randomized control trial (RCT) examining whey protein ingestion and bone health in postmenopausal women determined that high whey consumption resulted in higher serum IGF-1 levels, 7.3% at 1 year and 8% at 2 years. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21590739/

## Whey increases insulin
"Whey protein meal was accompanied by higher AUCs for insulin (90%) and GIP (54%)." 

(From the abstract titled "Glycemia and insulinemia in healthy subjects after lactose-equivalent meals of milk and other food proteins: the role of plasma amino acids and incretins")

"Conclusion: This study showed the onset of acne with the progressive use of protein-calorie supplementation, in a two-month period. It is suggested that this type of supplementation be discouraged."
