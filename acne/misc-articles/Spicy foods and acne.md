# Spicy foods and acne

## Associations
### Acne graded by professionals
> Patients with acne consumed significantly higher daily amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) (median 3367.54 mg) compared to the controls (median 2271.8 mg) (P < 0.001). A negative correlation between the amount of NaCl in the diet of patients with acne and the age of onset of acne lesions was detected (r = -0.216, P = 0.031).** However, neither salty nor spicy food correlated with duration or severity of the disease.**

### Self reported acne
> In addition, We found 5 risk factors associated with AV, the most contributing risk factor for AV of these 5 risk factors was stress (AOR = 18.85, 95% CI 6.313-56.281), regular eating of **spicy food** (AOR = 13.364, 95% CI 4.525-39.465) and the least contributing risk factor was eating fast food.

## Case control trial with 45 volunteers
> Changes in the mean number of noninflamed, inflamed or total lesions within the study period did not differ significantly between three study groups (p=0.22, 0.54 and 0.46, respectively). In patients receiving red pepper, mild amelioration of acne lesions was documented. According to the findings of this study, neither black pepper, nor red pepper is associated with exacerbation of acne lesions. Red pepper even may have mild ameliorating effect on acne lesions
