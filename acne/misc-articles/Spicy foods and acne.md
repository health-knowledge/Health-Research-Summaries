# Spicy foods and acne

## Associations
### Acne graded by professionals
> Patients with acne consumed significantly higher daily amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) (median 3367.54 mg) compared to the controls (median 2271.8 mg) (P < 0.001). A negative correlation between the amount of NaCl in the diet of patients with acne and the age of onset of acne lesions was detected (r = -0.216, P = 0.031).** However, neither salty nor spicy food correlated with duration or severity of the disease.**
