# Acne comorbidities

## Prostate (in men)

Late adolescent acne is associated with a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly for advanced stage disease:

> Men with late PEP, characterized by age at maximum height attainment at around 23 years and no history of acne, was inversely associated with incident (odds ratio [OR]: 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15–0.48, p trend <0.01) and high-grade prostate cancer (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09–0.59, p trend <0.01)

Late puberty onset and lack of acne during adolescence reduce high-grade prostate cancer at adulthood. The Prostate, 83(14), 1342–1350. https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.24596

> Students who reported a history of acne had a lower risk of all-cause (hazard ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 1.04) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.94) mortality **but had some evidence of a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio = 1.67, 95% CI: 0.79, 3.55)**

## Skin cancer and moles
> After thoroughly adjusting for the previously known risk factors for each cancer, we found that among women with a history of severe teenage acne, the relative risk increased, with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.01) for melanoma. We replicated this association in an independent melanoma case-control study of 930 cases and 1026 controls (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.56). We also found that in both studies the individuals with teenage acne were more likely to have moles (52.7% vs 50.1%, P < .001 in the cohort study; and 55.2% vs 45.1%, P = .004 in the case-control study).

## Hormones
> LH fell more slowly with age in the men with acne as compared to the controls. In our heterogeneous group of patients with acne vulgaris the findings suggest that a sub-group of men with acne have raised serum LH levels.

## C acnes antibodies in acne

Knop et al. (1983), *Anti-P. acnes antibody in comedonal extracts*

4. "Results indicate that levels of complement-fixing antibodies to C acnes are significantly higher in patients with acne than in control groups."  
Puhvel et al. (1966), *Corynebacterium Acnes Presence of Complement Fixing Antibodies to Corynebacterium acnes in the Sera of Patients With Acne Vulgaris*

5. "Results here revealed that antibodies to C. acnes and S. aureus were approximately 3-fold higher and 1.5-fold lower, respectively, in acne patients than in healthy subjects."

## C acnes antibodies linked to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
> In patients with biopsies negative for cancer, a high anti-P. acnes antibody titre was associated with high serum PSA levels (≥10.0 ng/mL, P = 0.04), and multiple linear regression analysis identified antibody titre as the predominant independent predictor of serum PSA level (P = 0.03)
