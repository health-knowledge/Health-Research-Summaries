We aimed to assess the effects of these topical treatments by collecting randomized controlled trials.\nMethods\nWe searched The Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to May 2019. We also searched five trials registers. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Meta analyses were performed by using Review Manager 5 software.\nResults\nWe included a total of 49 trials involving 3880 participants. In terms of treatment response (measured using participants\u2019 global self\u2010assessment of acne improvement, PGA), azelaic acid was probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.82, 95% CI 0.72\u20100.95). However, there was probably little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95% CI 0.78\u20101.14). There may be little or no difference when comparing salicylic acid to tretinoin (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.00, 95% CI 0.92\u20101.09). There were no studies measured PGA when evaluating nicotinamide.

The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear.\nTo assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne.\nWe searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers.\nClinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne.\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life.\nWe included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence).\nCompared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs.",

Clindamycin zinc gel contains zinc acetate in a formulation that reduces systemic absorption of clindamycin through the skin. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of a 1% clindamycin zinc gel when applied to the face once daily or twice daily with a 1% clindamycin lotion applied twice daily for 16 weeks in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Methods: This was a randomized, comparative, observer-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study involving 246 acne patients. Results: The study demonstrated therapeutic similarity between clindamycin zinc gel applied once and twice daily with clindamycin lotion applied twice daily. All three regimens produced a gradual and time-dependent reduction in inflamed lesions, non-inflamed lesions and overall grade. Side effects were similar and minimal, consisting predominantly of mild irritant dermatitis. All regimes produced a time-related significant reduction in skin surface and follicular Propionibacterium spp. and Micrococcaceae. The emergence of resistant strains was less than 5% and was similar with all three regimes. Conclusion: The equivalent efficacy and safety of clindamycin zinc gel either once or twice daily to clindamycin lotion twice daily has been demonstrated. It is suggested that a treatment regime of one application per day may significantly enhance compliance and thus treatment success in acne patients.",

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has long been used as a topical dosage form to treat acne. It has favorable effects in resolving inflammatory acne lesions not only by reducing Propioni bacterium acnes density, but also by directly inhibiting neutrophil chemotactic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Zinc, a metallic element has bacteriostatic activity against Propioni bacterium acnes. Combining zinc with antibiotic (erythromycin) can reduce antibiotic resistance and increase antibiotic absorption in-to the skin.\nMaterial and methods: In the present study, erythromycin (2% w/v) with zinc acetate (1.2% w/v) as 'topical gel' and erythromycin (2% w/v) gel alone were evaluated for treating mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. This double-blind study was carried out on 102 patients 13-25 years of age, divided into two groups. The group A received erythromycin and group B received erythromycin with zinc acetate topical gels during 3 weeks. Acne grading and lesion counts for comedones, papules and pustules were performed during each visit zero, first, second and third weeks.\nResults: Erythromycin treatment (with zinc acetate) gel showed to be more effective than erythromycin (alone) gel with respect to reducing the number of acne lesions and severity grade of acne.Number of lesions and severity of acne were significantly reduced at the end of 3rd week in both groups (p < .001).\nConclusions: In conclusion, it can be stated that erythromycin with and without zinc acetate was clinically effective, and both formulations produced a significant reductions in acne grading as well as inflamed and noninflamed lesion counts (p < .000).

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Considering the role of bacteria in causing some forms of acne, in recent years, the use of antibiotics along with other medications has had positive results in acne treatment; therefore, the present study aimed to compare the effect of the combination of topical erythromycin and zinc acetate with topical erythromycin alone in treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 76 patients with acne vulgaris who were referred to a specialized skin clinic were selected and randomly assigned into two treatment groups, namely, A (n=39) and B (n=37). Group A was treated with a local solution of erythromycin 4% without zinc acetate, and group B was treated with a combined local solution of erythromycin 4% and zinc acetate 1.2%. The treatment continued twice a day for three months. Results: In groups, A and B, respectively, the average lesion intensity score before treatment was 21.1 \u00b1 6.5 and 21.9 \u00b1 5.4 (P=0.555), the first month of treatment was 17.0 \u00b1 6.4 and 15.7 \u00b1 5.9 (P=0.578), the second month of treatment 9.1 \u00b1 4.5 and 6.4 \u00b1 3.3 (P=0.014), the third month of treatment 4.0 \u00b1 3.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 3.0 (P=0.001), and the frequency of complete recovery was 38.5 and 64.9%, respectively (P=0.021). In group B, the severity of papules in the second (P=0.002) and third (P=0.001) months of the treatment was significantly lower than in group A.

    "abstract": "Background\nApart from oral drug treatment, drug therapy in acne vulgaris comprises topical treatment with agents with a primarily keratolytic action (e.g. tretinoin and benzoylperoxide), and with antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin, and erythromycin\u2010zinc complex). The acne grade in the particular patient usually determines the selection of the preferred route of administration, viz. topical or oral, or a combination of both, and topical treatment is usually preferred in mild to moderate acne. The fact that a topically applied compound may also become systemically available to a quantifiable extent, is not generally considered.\nAim\nThe present paper reviews the clinical data on transdermal uptake of anti\u2010acne agents in man, also with respect to their relevance for daily clinical practice.\nOutcome\nThe majority of published data on transdermal penetration of topical anti\u2010acne agents focuses on the retinoid tretinoin, and on the antimicrobial agent clindamycin. This interest emerges from the fact that these agents have been associated with embryotoxicity/teratogenicity, and pseudomembranous colitis, respectively. For both compounds the extent of systemic availability after topical application is low, viz. 5\u20137% and 8%, respectively, at its highest. The height and variability in endogenous retinoid levels is very likely to outweigh any contribution of exogenously applied tretinoin, but a full consensus on the safe use of topical tretinoin in pregnancy is still lacking. With respect to clindamycin, the suggested association between its topical use and the occurrence of pseudomembranous colitis appears not to be of clinical relevance. In order to reduce systemic exposure to clindamycin as much as possible, topical application of clindamycin phosphate is to be preferred over clindamycin hydrochloride salt. Regarding other topical anti\u2010acne agents, it has been suggested that topical zinc\u2010erythromycin is to be preferred over erythromycin, both from clinical efficacy and safety viewpoints. With respect to the currently used compounds like benzoylperoxide, azelaic acid, and adapalene, available clinical pharmacokinetic data are scarce, and significant safety concerns did not emerge as yet.\nConclusion\nThe limited transdermal uptake of topical anti\u2010acne agents underpins their safe use in daily clinical practice. With respect to topical retinoids, formal consensus is lacking regarding their use in pregnancy.",

Poor compliance, however, is a major factor in the high failure rates seen in acne treatment. Compliance might be enhanced by considering patient preferences for acne medications. Conjoint analysis is well suited for the study of patient preferences in healthcare, but is novel to the field of dermatology.\nObjectives\u2002 The study aimed to determine and compare patient preferences for four topical antibiotics used for 1\u2003week, once or twice daily, to treat acne vulgaris.\nMethods\u2002 A randomised, phase IV, single\u2010centre, cross\u2010over study was performed using conjoint analysis and a traditional patient questionnaire. Over 4\u2003weeks, the patients used each of four topical antibiotics for 1\u2003week: erythromycin/zinc solution, clindamycin phosphate lotion, benzoyl peroxide (BP)/erythromycin gel (each applied twice daily) and clindamycin phosphate gel (applied once daily). The conjoint analysis examined five different attributes of acne medications: form, storage, product life once opened, method of application and regimen (each with two or three possible options). From 108 possible permutations of the five attributes, 16 hypothetical medications were selected at random and described on printed cards. Pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment, the patients ranked the cards in order of preference and rated each hypothetical product based on their likelihood to use it. For each patient, product \u2018utilities\u2019 were then calculated by multiple regression. The patients also completed a patient acceptability questionnaire, by which they rated the product acceptability after 1\u2003week of treatment with each of the four topical antibiotics. The patients later ranked the medications in order of preference after using all four treatments. Adverse events were recorded in diary cards to assess tolerability.\nResults\u2002 Of 67 patients recruited, 64 used all four medications and completed the study. The conjoint analysis found that a gel formulation, room temperature storage, product life of up to 18\u2003months once opened, application with fingers and once\u2010daily regimen were the options ranked first for the five product attributes. According to the ranking order (out of 108) for the combination of attributes representing the four study medications, clindamycin phosphate gel had the highest rankings (6 and 1 pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment, respectively) and BP/erythromycin gel had the lowest rankings (93 and 70 pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment). The rankings of clindamycin phosphate lotion and erythromycin/zinc solution worsened from pre\u2010 to post\u2010treatment, indicating a shift in patient preference after they experienced products \u2018in\u2010use\u2019 during the study. Based on the questionnaire, clindamycin phosphate gel was liked best by the highest proportion of patients (33%). In terms of overall satisfaction, the order of preference was: (i) clindamycin phosphate gel, (ii) clindamycin phosphate lotion, (iii) BP/erythromycin gel and (iv) erythromycin/zinc solution. Adverse events related to medication occurred most frequently with erythromycin/zinc solution and BP/erythromycin gel. Clindamycin phosphate gel was the only product not associated with any episodes resulting in a change of medication or dose.\nConclusions\u2002 Conjoint analysis provided a convenient, reliable tool for assessing patient preferences for topical antibiotics used to treat acne. The patients clearly preferred a gel formulation that could be applied with the fingers once daily and stored at room temperature for as long as 18\u2003months. One product (clindamycin phosphate gel) combined all five of the preferred attributes, a preference confirmed by the simulated product rankings. These findings of the conjoint analysis are consistent with the safety profiles and the results of the traditional questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Summary Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinisation, inflammation, and bacterial colonisation of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes . Although early colonisation with P acnes and family history might have important roles in the disease, exactly what triggers acne and how treatment affects the course of the disease remain unclear. Other factors such as diet have been implicated, but not proven. Facial scarring due to acne affects up to 20% of teenagers. Acne can persist into adulthood, with detrimental effects on self-esteem. There is no ideal treatment for acne, although a suitable regimen for reducing lesions can be found for most patients. Good quality evidence on comparative effectiveness of common topical and systemic acne therapies is scarce. Topical therapies including benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antibiotics when used in combination usually improve control of mild to moderate acne. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives can help women with acne. Patients with more severe inflammatory acne usually need oral antibiotics combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease antibiotic-resistant organisms. Oral isotretinoin is the most effective therapy and is used early in severe disease, although its use is limited by teratogenicity and other side-effects. Availability, adverse effects, and cost, limit the use of photodynamic therapy. New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.",

The most commonly reported AEs were associated with local skin irritation, usually mild to moderate in intensity, intermittent, and rarely led to the cessation of therapy. Irritative potential seems to be highest for BPO and topical retinoids. Due to the possibility of development of Cutibacterium acnes resistance, topical antibiotics should not be used in monotherapy but as a part of combination therapy.

These variations have a similar clinical and histologic appearance to acne vulgaris, but they are distinguishable by clinical setting, severity and associated symptoms. The common differential diagnosis of acne includes folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, peri oral dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. Combination therapy, for example with retinoids and antibiotics, is more effective than either agent used alone.13 However, the agents should be applied at separate times, unless they are known to be compatible.3 Benzoyl peroxide may oxidize a retinoid such as tretinoin if it is applied simultaneously.14 A 12- week randomized controlled trial involving 249 patients with mild to moderate acne showed treatment with adapalene gel 0.1% and clindamycin 1.0% to be superior to that with clindamycin 1.0% used alone.15 If inflammatory lesions are present, topical antibiotics containing benzoyl peroxide should be combined with a topical retinoid (e.g., topical antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide in the morning and retinoid at night). A review of three clinical studies with 1259 patients showed that a combination of clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% was more effective than either drug used alone in reducing lesions and suppressing P. acnes.16 Trials are being conducted with currently available therapies, in different strengths and combinations. Combining an allylamine antifungal agent with benzoyl peroxide may prove to enhance the effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide in treating acne while preventing antibiotic resistance.18 Topical dapsone 5% gel is a newer option for treating acne.

The aim of this open-label trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a new non-corticosteroid, antifungal/anti-inflammatory/antiseborrheic cream containing piroctone olamine, stearyl glycyrrhetinate, and zinc PCA in the treatment of facial SD using clinical and instrumental evaluation.\nTwenty adult subjects affected by mild-to-moderate inflamed facial SD were enrolled and instructed to apply the study cream twice daily for 60 days. Efficacy was evaluated at baseline, and at days 15, 30, and 60 by measuring the grade of desquamation, erythema, and pruritus using clinical evaluation, erythema-directed digital photography, colorimetry, and subject-completed Visual Analog Scale. Additionally, an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was assessed using a 5-point scale: excellent response (>80% improvement); good response (50%-80% improvement); mild response (<50% improvement); no response (no change); worsening.\nAfter 15 days, a statistically significant decrease from baseline was found in desquamation, erythema, colorimetric scores, and pruritus. At day 60, a significant further improvement for all evaluated parameters was recorded. Moreover, the IGA improved in 90% of patients, with an excellent response in 53% of cases. A good correlation was found between clinical and instrumental evaluations.\nOur results indicate that the study facial cream represents an option to consider when dealing with mild-to-moderate SD, being effective, well-tolerated, and free of significant side effects, as confirmed by clinical and instrumental evaluation.",

The tested rock is an ash-rich epiclastite collected in Northern\u2013Central part of Sardinia island (Italy). ICP chemical analyses of the bulk rock evidenced a composition compatible with topical applications. A 66 wt.% of clinoptilolite content was determined by means of XRD analysis (reference intensity ratio [RIR] technique). EDS chemical analyses of zeolite crystals were performed on polished thin section. The CEC of the rock is 1.45\u00b10.08 meq/g. Using a specific exchange method, the material was previously Na-conditioned then Zn-conditioned. A substantially complete Zn-form was obtained, as demonstrated by AAS analyses. A back-exchange reaction toward Na-form was performed in the same conditions (65 \u00b0C in 1 M NaCl solution): zinc release was fast and almost complete (94%). Zn-conditioned powder was then micronized to achieve a volume/surface ratio suitable for a topical therapy. After micronization, the specific surface area, determined by BET gas adsorption, was 30.2 m\n2/g, and 92% of the powdered rock was lower than 30 \u03bcm in size (measured by a Coulter Counter apparatus); the so-called \u201cvolume-surface diameter\u201d was 6.48 \u03bcm, compatible with the intended topical application.

    "abstract": "Topical antibacterial agents are an essential part of the armamentarium for treating acne vulgaris. They are indicated for mild-to-moderate acne, and are a useful alternative for patients who cannot take systemic antibacterials. Topical antibacterials such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline are bacteriostatic for Propionibacterium acnes, and have also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activities through inhibition of lipase production by P. acnes, as well as inhibition of leukocyte chemotaxis. Benzoyl peroxide is a non-antibiotic antibacterial agent that is bactericidal against P. acnes and has the distinct advantage that thus far, no resistance has been detected against it. Combined agents such as erythromycin/zinc, erythromycin/tretinoin, erythromycin/isotretinoin, erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide are increasingly being used and have been proven to be effective. They generally demonstrate good overall tolerability and are useful in reducing the development of antibacterial resistance in P. acnes. The selection of a topical antibacterial agent should be tailored for specific patients by choosing an agent that matches the patient's skin characteristics and acne type. Topical antibacterial agents should generally not be used for extended periods beyond 3 months, and topical antibacterials should ideally not be combined with systemic antibacterial therapy for acne; in particular, the use of topical and systemic antibacterials is to be avoided as far as possible.",

They appear currently as components of many consumer products such as sunscreen, dressings, sports clothes, surface-cleaning agents, computer devices, paints, as well as pharmaceutical and cosmetics formulations. The use of NPs in products for topical applications improves the permeation/penetration of the bioactive compounds into deeper layers of the skin, providing a depot effect with sustained drug release and specific cellular and subcellular targeting. Nanocarriers provide advances in dermatology and systemic treatments. Examples are a non-invasive method of vaccination, advanced diagnostic techniques, and transdermal drug delivery. The mechanism of action of NPs, efficiency of skin penetration, and potential threat to human health are still open and not fully explained. This review gives a brief outline of the latest nanotechnology achievements in products used in topical applications to prevent and treat skin diseases. We highlighted aspects such as the penetration of NPs through the skin (influence of physical-chemical properties of NPs, the experimental models for skin penetration, methods applied to improve the penetration of NPs through the skin, and methods applied to investigate the skin penetration by NPs).

    "abstract": "Acne is characterized by primary lesions on the face, chest, and back, and by a variety of other signs and symptoms. In particular, acne inflammatory lesions result from Propionibacterium acnes colonization and are of particular relevance as they can cause permanent scarring. Acne also causes significant psychological morbidity in affected patients. Products currently available for the treatment of acne include systemic and topical treatments. As these products can cause severe side effects, new, innovative therapies are needed. Farmaka Acne Cream (FAC) is a novel, film-forming cream developed to treat mild and moderate acne. In vitro studies have demonstrated that FAC is as effective as 5% benzoyl peroxide in inhibiting growth of P. acnes. In 32 subjects with mild or moderate acne, FAC reduced all the major signs and symptoms of the disease. These included itching, erythema, and scaling, as well as reductions in the numbers of papules, pustules, and open and closed comedones. Acne severity improved in 38% of subjects, while none worsened. FAC was found to be effective in controlling sebum secretion, and was non-comedogenic. Most subjects (90%) reported tolerability as good or very good, while clinical efficacy and cosmetic acceptability were judged as good. For assessment of contact sensitization and photosensitization, FAC was applied daily to the backs of 29 subjects in two symmetric areas for 10 days. Using a solar stimulator, one minimal erythema dose was delivered to one side of the back from days 11 to 13. The four different subareas of treated/untreated and irradiated/nonirradiated and combinations thereof were compared. No cases of contact sensitization or photosensitization were observed, and FAC is considered safe for use in intense sunlight. In vitro and in vivo studies provide evidence for the safety and clinical benefits of FAC, a promising candidate for the treatment of mild and moderate acne.",

An updated regulatory framework, considering the promising applications in nanomedicine, and the toxicity of these nanosystems are also addressed.\nExpert opinion: Nanosystems evidence several advantages, attending to the possibility of controlled active ingredient release, better skin permeation, and lower skin irritation. However, novel nanotechnological strategies for acne treatment and care can lead to new side effects, but also environmental nano pollution. Little is known about the toxicology of these nanotechnology-based formulations, therefore, as future trends, more studies should be conducted to assure the consumers' health and environmental safety.",

Most of these factors converge on mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) activation which is further enhanced by the nutrient signaling of Western diet. This multitude of pathogenic factors has led to a new armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of acne. Topical anti-androgens, insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-modulators, acetylcholine inhibitors, topical retinoic acid metabolism-blocking agents, vitamin D analogues, antimicrobial peptides, interleukin-1\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 blockers and immunotherapy are some of the novel treatment options.",

Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline-derived antibiotic currently used systemically to treat a wide range of infections caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition to its antibiotic activity, minocycline possesses anti-inflammatory properties, such as the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, suppression of neutrophil chemotaxis, activation of superoxide dismutase, and inhibition of phagocytosis, among others. These characteristics make minocycline a valuable agent for treatment of dermatological diseases such as acne vulgaris and papulopustular rosacea.

Our literature review includes searches of Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the databases of the Cochrane Library. A detailed search strategy is included. All searches were limited to controlled trials and systematic reviews. No year limits were applied to the searches, but we focused on trials, guidelines, and reviews published since 2004, the year that the last review of topical antimicrobials was published in this journal. Several controlled trials demonstrate that benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, and topical retinoids used in combination provide the greatest efficacy and safety profile for the treatment of mild to moderate acne, but there are few trials directly comparing different combinations of these topical therapies with one another. Additionally, robust studies comparing cost and efficacy of generic combinations of the above agents with proprietary fixed-dose combination therapies that may increase compliance are also lacking. Although they have not been extensively studied, alternative agents including dapsone, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, and zinc are safe and efficacious when combined with traditional therapies.

However, the clinical evidence of topical probiotic lotion and acne treatment is still lacking.\nObjective\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotic\u2010derived lotion compared with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of mild\u2010to\u2010moderate acne vulgaris.\nMethods\nTopical probiotic\u2010derived lotion was formulated from cell\u2010free supernatant of L.\u00a0paracasei MSMC 39\u20101. In vitro study showed the ability of the supernatant to inhibit both antibiotic\u2010resistance and\u2010susceptibility strains of C.\u00a0acnes and inhibit tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1. The patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate acne vulgaris on the face were randomized to receive topical probiotic\u2010derived lotion or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Acne lesion counts, erythema index, and side effects were assessed after 2 and 4\u00a0weeks of treatment.\nResults\nOne hundred and four acne vulgaris patients were enrolled. After four weeks of treatment, the inflammatory acne lesion counts and erythema index significantly decreased compared with the baseline in both the probiotic\u2010derived lotion group and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide group (p < 0.001 in both groups) without statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05).

    "abstract": "The skin microbiome is an essential barrier for preventing the invasion of pathogens and regulating the immune responses. When this barrier is disrupted, several dermatoses, including acne vulgaris, may arise. Most people will experience acne starting at the onset of puberty and continuing into adolescence; a significant percentage of those individuals continue to suffer from it into adulthood. Although common, this dermatosis usually has an enormous impact on the self-esteem and quality of life of individuals who suffer from it. An increase in consumer literacy regarding skincare leads buyers to seek out innovative products containing ingredients with proven benefits for their concerns. Probiotics have proven to be an alternative to the use of antibiotics, often associated with undesirable effects, in the treatment and prevention of dermatological disorders such as acne. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the pathophysiology, risk factors, symptoms, conventional treatment recommendations and main studies emphasizing innovative topical products for acne-prone skin based on probiotics. In addition, the potential advantages, and limitations/challenges associated with the implementation and manufacturing of these innovative skin products are also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified-release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side-effects.\nTo assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris.\nSearches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012.\nWe selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated.\nOutcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta-analyses were undertaken where possible.Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects.\nWe included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline.The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta-analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly-used acne treatments. One company-sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used.The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended-release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations.\nMinocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly-used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first-line use, even though the price-differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common disease of adolescence that occurs in approximately 80% of the population aged 11-30 years. The disease greatly reduces well-being and self-esteem. In the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris many factors take part: genetic, hormonal, sebaceous gland hyperplasia with seborrhoea, changes in the composition of sebum, comedones formation, Propionibacterium acnes colonization and inflammation. In most cases, the disease does not require systemic treatment, and the available causal therapy and topical acne skin care are sufficient to improve skin condition. In acne vulgaris, local systematic treatment adjusted to the form of the disease, as monotherapy or combination therapy, is required. Keratolytic and anti-comedone drugs are salicylic acid, retinoids and benzoyl peroxide. Some antibiotics, such as clindamycin, erythromycin and erythromycini cyclocarbonas, as well as benzoyl peroxide, have anti-bacterial properties. Antibiotics such as macrolides and tetracyclines, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, azelaic acid, and vitamin B3 have anti-inflammatory properties. Only azelaic acid has a weak anti-seborrhoeic effect. 17\u03b2-oestradiol and zinc ions have the action of anti-androgens by competitive action on the receptors. The only substances that theoretically affect all elements of the aetiopathogenesis are triethyl citrate, linolan acetate and azelaic acid.

In this supplement, we focus on the fourth category, the iatrogenic origin of fragile skin and the role that dermo\u2010cosmetics can have in restoring the natural protective function of the skin following treatments for skin diseases and medical interventions. We present epidemiological data on the prevalence of fragile skin in three different geographical regions, and the results of two randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy and tolerability of dermo\u2010cosmetics in combination with topical acne treatment and following physical skin damage. Overall, we found that prevalence across the three regions (23% in Germany, 41% in UAE, 56% in Taiwan) reflected previous global estimates (24\u201353%) across skin types, with significant associations found with environmental and lifestyle factors, such as stress, humidity and pollution.

    "abstract": "Apart from oral drug treatment, drug therapy in acne vulgaris comprises topical treatment with agents with a primarily keratolytic action (e.g. tretinoin and benzoylperoxide), and with antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin, and erythromycin-zinc complex). The acne grade in the particular patient usually determines the selection of the preferred route of administration, viz. topical or oral, or a combination of both, and topical treatment is usually preferred in mild to moderate acne. The fact that a topically applied compound may also become systemically available to a quantifiable extent, is not generally considered.\nThe present paper reviews the clinical data on transdermal uptake of anti-acne agents in man, also with respect to their relevance for daily clinical practice.\nThe majority of published data on transdermal penetration of topical anti-acne agents focuses on the retinoid tretinoin, and on the antimicrobial agent clindamycin. This interest emerges from the fact that these agents have been associated with embryotoxicity/teratogenicity, and pseudomembranous colitis, respectively. For both compounds the extent of systemic availability after topical application is low, viz. 5-7% and 8%, respectively, at its highest. The height and variability in endogenous retinoid levels is very likely to outweigh any contribution of exogenously applied tretinoin, but a full consensus on the safe use of topical tretinoin in pregnancy is still lacking. With respect to clindamycin, the suggested association between its topical use and the occurrence of pseudomembranous colitis appears not to be of clinical relevance. In order to reduce systemic exposure to clindamycin as much as possible, topical application of clindamycin phosphate is to be preferred over clindamycin hydrochloride salt. Regarding other topical anti-acne agents, it has been suggested that topical zinc-erythromycin is to be preferred over erythromycin, both from clinical efficacy and safety viewpoints. With respect to the currently used compounds like benzoylperoxide, azelaic acid, and adapalene, available clinical pharmacokinetic data are scarce, and significant safety concerns did not emerge as yet.\nThe limited transdermal uptake of topical anti-acne agents underpins their safe use in daily clinical practice. With respect to topical retinoids, formal consensus is lacking regarding their use in pregnancy.",

The microwave approach was used to develop the MA-AgNPs, which were then optimized using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). Particle size (Y1) and absorbance (Y2) were chosen as the response variables, while AgNO\n(X1), methyl anthranilate concentration (X2), and microwave power (X3) were chosen as the independent variables. Additionally, the prepared AgNPs were approximated for investigations on in vitro active ingredient release, dermatokinetics, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The study's findings showed that the optimal MA-loaded AgNPs formulation had a particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and percentage entrapment efficiency (EE) of 200 nm, 0.296 mV, -25.34 mV, and 87.88%, respectively. The image from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated the spherical shape of the nanoparticles. According to an in vitro investigation on active ingredient release, MA-AgNPs and MA suspension released the active ingredient at rates of 81.83% and 41.62%, respectively. The developed MA-AgNPs formulation was converted into a gel by using Carbopol 934 as a gelling agent. The spreadability and extrudability of MA-AgNPs gel were found to be 16.20 and 15.190, respectively, demonstrating that the gel may spread very easily across the skin's surface. The MA-AgNPs formulation demonstrated improved antioxidant activity in comparison to pure MA. The MA-AgNPs sunscreen gel formulation displayed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behaviour, which is typical of skin-care products, and was found to be stable during the stability studies. The sun protection factor (SPF) value of MA-AgNPG was found to be 35.75. In contrast to the hydroalcoholic Rhodamine B solution (5.0 \u00b5m), the CLSM of rat skin treated with the Rhodamine B-loaded AgNPs formulation showed a deeper penetration of 35.0 \u00b5m, indicating the AgNPs formulation was able to pass the barrier and reach the skin's deeper layers for more efficient delivery of the active ingredient. This can help with skin conditions where deeper penetration is necessary for efficacy. Overall, the results indicated that the BBD-optimized MA-AgNPs provided some of the most important benefits over conventional MA formulations for the topical delivery of methyl anthranilate.",
